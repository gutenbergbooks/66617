<small>WESTMINSTER BRIDGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Night</span> clad the imperial city in a black robe
stitched with fire.</p>

<p>The misty river rolled in from the sea through
its illuminated bridges with the subdued swish of
some great snake writhing its way through hoops
of gold.</p>

<p>Out in the fog-haunted region between the bridges
the movement of the red and green-eyed steam-tugs,
clutching invisible barges and dragging them away
into the darkness, seemed like a shadow-show in which
grotesque demons were hunting the souls of men.</p>

<p>The two banks of the river offered a contrast full
of significance.</p>

<p>Along the left bank white lamps that slit the dusk
with the hard, bright glare of diamonds were strung
like beads at measured spaces apart. A broad,
smooth-paven road rattled with the wheels of traffic,
and the long bend of the river revealed a sweep of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
stately buildings representing the power and splendour
of a great civilization.</p>

<p>Education, law, science, government, police, had
their homes side by side along that mighty fa&ccedil;ade,
which thus became an entablature on which the characters
of civilization were legibly impressed. Beside
the ancient universities of the law stood the
headquarters of the vast machinery for the teaching
of the populace&mdash;that is to say, for the taming of
successive generations of barbarians. The power of
wealth was expressed in luxurious hotels and club-houses,
in the mansion of the noble and the estate-office
of the millionaire. The revenues of empire
flowed in and out through the gates of one majestic
pile; from another the guardians of the social order
waged war against the restless ranks of crime. Last
in place towered the huge palace of the imperial
Legislature, supreme over all.</p>

<p>Across the river the low mass of the southern shore
lay in obscurity. All that could be distinguished over
there was a dark roof-line broken by a few tall,
smokeless chimneys, rising above the water like the
walls and towers of a beleaguered city encompassed
by its moat. The solitary illumination on that side
of the river was afforded by a high square building
which broke the gloom from instant to instant with
huge letters of yellow fire, spelling out uncouth, barbaric
syllables in what might have been the jargon
of some subterranean race of men. Seen across the
river mist the tower flared out like those burning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
mosques beheld from afar by the voyager in the
Underworld as he drew near to the city of Dis.</p>

<p>All night the square, ugly minaret continued to flash
its monstrous hieroglyphs upon the darkness, as
though the dwellers on the southern shore were signalling
a message from their camp. And from time
to time, when the rattle of the wheels on the hither
side stayed for a moment, there was borne across the
water the low, sullen hum as of a vast multitude
swarming in the narrow streets and stunted houses
of the hidden region beyond.</p>

<p>Thus the two banks of the river faced each other
with something of a mutual threat.</p>

<p>On one side of the gulf, that low, sombre roof-line
with its fitful torch-fires; on the other side, the broad
illuminated rampart of civilization, crowned by its
imperial keep.</p>

<p>A light more brilliant than the rest streamed from
the summit of the ponderous clock-tower that guards
the foot of Westminster Bridge.</p>

<p>This was the answering signal of the northern shore
to that sullen camp across the river. It burned there
to proclaim that the sovereign power of empire was
at work beneath, judging over five hundred millions
of men, and two and a half continents. All the forces
of the mightiest society the world has yet beheld
were focused here in the High Court of Parliament,
the Board of the Anglo-Roman Raj.</p>

<p>Here the decrees were shaped in obedience to which
invincible fleets crossed the ocean; armies were transported<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
from one hemisphere to the conquest of another;
kings were dethroned in Africa and other kings
were crowned in Asia; warlike republics were extinguished
under the Southern Pole, and tottering dynasties
propped up in the shadow of the Himalayas;
whole races of men, speaking strange tongues, and
reckoning time by other constellations, had their laws
and manners and religions changed for them; immemorial
savagery was thrust into the forcing-house
of civilization, and immemorial civilizations were
rooted up; from this centre the hardy freemen of the
Baltic North spread the ancient Mediterranean culture
and Semitic folklore wherever the Raj extended
round the globe.</p>

<p>Here throbbed the great piston-rod which drove
the myriad wheels of government and slowly stamped
deeper age after age the same Roman-Semitic imprint
upon the subjugated populace at home.</p>

<p>Night after night, as the dwellers on the southern
shore gazed across at the majestic citadel of the Raj,
they saw that beacon burning, the symbol of the unresting
watchfulness of their rulers against the assaults
of foes within and without. That steady flame
shone out defiance alike to the foreign invader and
the traitor within the gates; to the rebels who scoured
the African veldt, and the more dangerous rebels who
skulked through the streets and alleys of the imperial
capital. On all alike, on the encroaching Tsar
as on the plotting Maharajah, on far-off savages and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
on felons crouching at the gates, the Genius of the
Raj was seen to keep its never-closing eye.</p>

<p>More than a mile away, round the curving bank
of the river, where the warehouses of Mammon clustered
thickly round the temple of Jehovah, there rose
another Symbol, invisible in the night, soaring high
above the intervening territory of squalor.</p>

<p>This Symbol was intended to represent a Roman
gibbet, the gibbet on which a Redeemer had been put
to death two thousand years ago, in a remote corner
of that ancient Mediterranean realm of which this
modern civilization was heir.</p>

<p>In the night these two Symbols confronted each
other, the Flame and the Cross, as though they were
the warring ensigns of Ahura-Mazda, the Spirit of
Light, and Anru-Mainya, the Spirit of Darkness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the midmost arch of Westminster Bridge a
young man stood alone, leaning over the parapet, and
sounding with his eyes the black depth of the water
below.</p>

<p>His whole air and appearance were out of harmony
with the spot where he found himself, and suggested
that he must have strayed there from some gayer
quarter of the town. An opera hat was thrust back
on his head, and a silk-lined overcoat, thrown open
in front, allowed his waistcoat, of white satin, to
become soiled by contact with the grime of the bridge.
He held a cane of rich and fanciful design in one
hand; the other hand, resting loosely on the ironwork<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
of the balustrade, showed more than one curious and
valuable ring.</p>

<p>He leaned on the bridge dully, his head drooping
as though he were tired. Although his face was that
of a man not yet thirty years of age, it bore marks
which showed that he had lived too eagerly, without
heed to life&#8217;s immitigable laws. Already the forehead
was crossed with faint lines, though there was
no thinning of the black hair that curled above. The
beauty of the face was marred by the flush of intemperance,
and the sensuous underlip contradicted
the refinement of the sensitive nostrils. The dark,
restless eyes and delicate chin completed the impression
of passion and weakness which was left by the
whole face.</p>

<p>On the pavement of St. James&#8217;s such a figure would
have seemed at home. Seen where it was, like a tropical
bird blown ashore on some bleaker landscape, it
provoked the curiosity of the passers-by.</p>

<p>Some of them took offence at the unusual sight.
A group of roughs returning from some haunt of
vice on the north side to their dens across the river
eyed the well-dressed loiterer with envious contempt,
and tried to hustle him as they went by. Their leader,
a hulking Irishman, encouraged them in a coarse
speech, which still breathed faintly of the sea-scented
glens of Connemara.</p>

<p>Something in the voice or in the words startled
the lounger. He turned his head quickly, and gave
the ruffian a questioning look, under which he slunk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
to one side, and passed on with his friends. In the
dark streets where their homes lay they might not
have been abashed so easily. But their courage for
violence ebbed on the well-lighted bridge. Few crimes
are committed at high noon.</p>

<p>A policeman sauntering on to the bridge shortly
afterwards caught sight of the stranger, and seemed
to become interested in his doings. Instead of pursuing
his way when he had reached the farther end
of the bridge, the officer halted, and stood about on
the pavement by St. Thomas&#8217;s Hospital, keeping his
eyes fixed on the figure that overhung the balustrade
so persistently.</p>

<p>Two shop-boys coming along in their turn had their
sense of humour tickled by the young man&#8217;s forlorn
attitude. One of them gave vent to a ribald jest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; he said aloud to his comrade, &#8220;there&#8217;s
Jesus Christ.&#8221;</p>

<p>So closely wrapped in his own thoughts was the
lounger that it was many seconds after they had been
uttered before the words succeeded in penetrating to
his consciousness. The last sound of the youths&#8217;
trampling feet had died away at the end of the bridge
before he woke up sufficiently to ask himself with a
resentful air: &#8220;What made him say that?&#8221;</p>

<p>He found himself unable to dismiss the jeer from
his mind, in which it went on echoing with such tormenting
insistence that at last he stood up and shook
himself, unconsciously making a physical effort to
change the pattern in the brain&#8217;s kaleidoscope.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>But the suggestion which so irritated him was not
to be got rid of in that fashion. It chimed in too
well with the whole tenor of his meditation since he
had found his way on to the bridge. The half-formed
questions which had been baffling his attempts to give
them definite shape now all at once began to come
together and settle down into one question, precipitated,
as it were, by that profane mockery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he reflected, with a growing sense of anger
at the comparison&mdash;&#8220;why did he call me that?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not because he attributed any serious intention
to the jester that he argued thus with himself.
He was in that mood when everything around us
appears mysterious and fraught with some revelation
to which we only need a key. The words of the shop-boy
became for him a hint from the night itself, like
the cryptic utterances of the characters in a play of
Maeterlinck&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;What likeness is there between Christ and me?&#8221;
he went on, putting the problem before himself more
distinctly.</p>

<p>What likeness, indeed, between this spoilt child of
civilization, to whom the world seemed to have given
of its best, for whom Christianity could be no more
than a legend, and that buffeted Redeemer hanging
on his gibbet in the Syrian sun of two thousand years
ago?</p>

<p>And yet an insult cannot rankle unless it is barbed
with truth. From the inner cells of memory, where
they had been stored up in past days by a religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
mother, certain words and phrases were already coming
forth, as though moved by some subtle affinity,
to answer that uncomfortable question.</p>

<p><i>Despised and rejected of men</i>&mdash;they ran something
like that. And again: <i>Stricken, smitten of God, and
afflicted</i>. There were other words which should have
followed, surely, but he tried in vain to draw them
forth.</p>

<p><i>Despised and rejected of men.</i> The flush darkened
on the young man&#8217;s cheek as he flung back his head
with a rebellious and angry glance at the river&#8217;s northern
bank, where the shining walls and towers of the
city of Ormuzd seemed to overhang the gulf&mdash;the
glance which an exile gives at the city which has
driven him forth.</p>

<p>He had fled to the spot, stunned by one of those
buffets which life is ever waiting to deal to those who
have not learnt their lesson aright. And his ears still
smarted with the scream of the newsboys who were
proclaiming in every street that Lord Alistair Stuart
had failed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In London men like Alistair Stuart fail every day,
and go under, leaving scarcely a ripple on the smooth
surface of a society which hastens to forget all disagreeable
things. But Lord Alistair&#8217;s catastrophe had
been able to eclipse for one night the comedy of politics
and the tragedy of war. For he happened to be
one of the few in whom the world is interested, and
when the world is interested in a man it will not suffer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
him to go down to sheol in peace. Its hisses are
the reaction of its cheers, and those who court its
notice put their lives to the hazard, like Esther when
she went to touch the sceptre of Ahasuerus.</p>

<p>The world knew Alistair Stuart in two characters&mdash;as
the brother and heir-presumptive of the Duke
of Trent and Colonsay, and as the lover of Molly
Finucane.</p>

<p>To the outer world, for which newspapers are written
and formal histories compiled, he was the brother
of one of its most important citizens. The Duke
of Trent was distinguished not only by his rank, but
by his service to the State. By an ironical coincidence
the same <i>Gazette</i> which revealed the fact that Lord
Alistair Stuart had filed his petition also contained
the notification that his brother had kissed hands as
Secretary of State. It was impossible that the moralists
of the pulpit and the press should overlook the
striking example of the idle and industrious apprentice,
and the younger brother&#8217;s disgrace was deepened
by the elder&#8217;s triumph.</p>

<p>In that inner world whose newspapers are the boudoirs
and the smoking-rooms, and which goes for
its history to memoirs and chronicles of the back-stairs,
the name of Alistair Stuart had gained celebrity
in connection with a personage of whom the pulpit
might not know, and the press might not tell.</p>

<p>Molly Finucane had achieved one of those reputations
which have given certain women a place in
history. In the ancient world she might have had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
princes to fight for her, and poets to sing her praise.
In the modern world she was a figure of evil, regarded
with a feeling like that which inspired the
legends of the succubi. An element of mystery attached
to her extraordinary career. It was said that
she could neither dance nor sing, that she was astonishingly
ignorant, and that her speech and ways smelt
of the gutter. Even beauty was denied her. The
men whom she had ruined themselves could not explain
the secret of her power over them; she overcame
her victims like a malarial fever. Some men
could meet her day after day without succumbing;
others lost themselves from the first; others again
began by despising her as an ugly little street-girl,
and ended by giving her their wives&#8217; jewels.</p>

<p>How many had perished in the maelstrom of desire
which she created none could say. But there
was a ghastly story of the young Earl of St. Luc,
who had put an end to his life at the age of twenty
because his trustees refused him the means to set up
an establishment for Molly Finucane. An ineffaceable
impression had been made by the two contrasted
pictures of the desolate mother weeping over her
boy&#8217;s dead body, as it was dragged all stained and
dripping from the moat surrounding the ancient keep
of the St. Lucs, and of the wide-mouthed, stupid Irish
girl, planted in a reek of tobacco smoke on a table
crowded by tipsy youths, repeating to them in her
cracked, shameless voice the latest and most brutally
coarse refrain of the street.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>It was a year, perhaps two years, since the tongue
of scandal had first singled out the name of Alistair
Stuart from among the rest of those who singed their
wings in this fatal flame. Gradually it became known
that Molly Finucane had given him a devotion which
no other man had ever been able to buy with gold
or blood or tears. For his sake she had refused at
the last moment to take possession of the miniature
palace furnished for her by the great Brazilian
broker, Mendes; who had simply shrugged his shoulders
and ordered the house to be kept vacant and
ready for her. Stuart and she had gone to live together
in a faded corner of Chelsea, in a house surrounded
by elms with black trunks and yellow leaves.</p>

<p>The house in Chelsea loomed large in the mind of
the new generation. It was regarded as a citadel of
sin, as the headquarters of a cult which gloried in
its moral degeneracy. Alistair Stuart assumed the
character of a high-priest among the pagans, as they
chose to call themselves&mdash;poets whose verses echoed
still more faintly the faint autumnal sighs of Verlaine;
wits whose epigrams were brilliant with the
phosphorescence of corruption; men in whom genius
was a vice, and vice an affectation. Hatred of the
middle classes was the watchword of this sect, which
was recruited from penniless younger sons, from university
failures, from a whole class for whom the
Protestant Church has no refuge, but who in Catholic
countries end often in the monastery. They waged
war on the Victorian Age, on its religion, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
its art, on its commercialism, but, above all, on its
Puritanism.</p>

<p>In the eyes of this brotherhood of the unfit bankruptcy
was rather meritorious than disgraceful, and
the fifty thousand pounds which Stuart had spent
without possessing represented so much spoil taken
from the Philistines. Stuart&#8217;s own first proceeding
after he had signed the warrant for his civil degradation
had been to send forth invitations for a supper
to celebrate the event.</p>

<p>His bankruptcy had been in one sense voluntary.
Although he had cut himself off from intercourse with
his family when he took the house in Chelsea, he
knew that Trent would have helped him to make
terms with his creditors. But he knew also that Trent
would have required him to give up Molly Finucane.
He had filed his petition with a light heart, in the
belief that the disgrace would fall more heavily on
his brother than on himself.</p>

<p>For the &eacute;clat resulting from his act he had been
prepared, but not for the effect of the &eacute;clat on his
own mind.</p>

<p>He had been on his way to a club in Piccadilly
overlooking the Green Park, which served as a meeting-ground
for those members of the cult who kept
on terms with respectability. Almost on the club
steps he was arrested by the sight of his name in large
letters on a news-bill, bringing the sharp reminder
that he had forfeited his right of entry.</p>

<p>It was a shock to him to find that his exploit had
suddenly lost its charm. He bought a paper as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
walked on, and read of his brother&#8217;s promotion to
the Cabinet. The unforeseen coincidence intensified
his discomfiture. This brother of his, whom he had
always looked on as a dullard and a prig, whom he
had so often sneered at among his own friends, was
standing there crowned in front of the footlights,
while he, Alistair, was being hissed off the stage. In
a flash he saw the ruin he had made of his life, and
was dismayed.</p>

<p>And as he wandered miserably through the streets
the question that had risen and struggled for expression
in his mind was&mdash;Why? Why had his brother
so far surpassed him in the race? Why were the
honours and rewards of life bestowed on some and
not on others? Why had he, Alistair, steered his
bark upon the rocks?</p>

<p>Standing there between that visible theatre of his
brother&#8217;s triumph, on the north side of the river, and
the unknown hooligan realm upon the south, with
which there stole upon him a daunting sense of affinity,
he pondered the question; and while he pondered
it, the feeling grew upon him that it would not be
answered by itself, that it was a part of a more tremendous
issue, that the meaning of life was involved
in it, and the eternal mystery of the world.</p>

<p>Alistair looked back for some clue to the tangled
skein of his career; and by-and-by the vista of the
past took on distinctness, like one of those marvellous
canvases of Rembrandt from whose dingy surface
there gradually peeps out a whole magical landscape
charged with light.</p>

<small>BIOGRAPHICAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> lustre of the rain was over the grey lochs and
green Hebrides.</p>

<p>The broad sound that stretched between the Island
of Oig and the mainland was crinkled in furrows, on
whose torn edges the foam-spit flickered like driving
snowflakes. Whenever the indigo folds of the rolling
rain parted for a minute the white beaches of
Kesteven gleamed out like a picked bone. Away to
the southward, where the fishing-boats were slowly
reaching round the Mull of Oig, their taut sails glistened
like new-washed tiles in the sunshine; then, as
they twisted about and came up into the wind, the
light emptied out of their sails like water being spilt,
and each boat in turn became a murky phantom gliding
forward along leaden grooves.</p>

<p>When the rain-wreaths closed round again, the
mainland was blotted out with its hills and pine-forests,
and the fishing-boats were no longer anything
but blurred hints of things behind a screen. The mist
wrapped the Island of Oig round with a great stillness,
as though it had been removed a thousand miles
off into the midst of the sea.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>When at last the heavy cloud phalanxes broke and
drifted overhead, and the lochs and isles lay in clear
day, something new had crossed into the magic ring
of the horizon.</p>

<p>Down in the south-east, in the far-off corner of
the landscape, where the pale rose-purple of the hills
melted into the dark slate-purple of the waves, a low
black smudge had come like a flake of soot on a glorious
stained-glass window. Seen at first as a mere
speck on the picture, it swiftly spread and grew till
it became a great dingy smear trailing across the
heavens. And there was something about this new
presence in the landscape which made it seem strange
and hostile to the rest. It was as though a harsh,
unexpected note had been struck in the middle of a
symphony. All the other things there&mdash;the clouds
and the sunlight, the hills and the sea&mdash;seemed to
have grown used to one another during the ages, and
to keep up a stately accord together; but this smoke
giant forced himself in amongst them, like an upstart
that had not learnt their ways&mdash;an ugly gnome of
the underworld breaking into the haunts of the fairies
and the nixies.</p>

<p>Beneath the inky banner a small black steamer
lifted its hull above the wave-line and came on obstinately,
beating defiance with its paddles to the
mother elements. The fishing-boats that for thousands
of years had put in and out from the little
haven of Oig had never done aught but coax the elemental
forces in order to turn them to service. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
them the winds and the tides had been instruments
on which they searched, as it were, for the right
chords. But this masterful intruder snapped the
strings in careless discord; compared with the others,
it seemed to be a burglar breaking the locks of Nature
with a crowbar instead of opening them with a key.</p>

<p>Fussing and fretting as it came, the steamboat
struck right through the fleet of fishing-boats, and
hurried on. It churned its way noisily into the harbour,
driving small rowing-boats to right and left
like frightened birds, and took up its berth against
the pier with the air of an invading column taking
up its quarters in a surrendered town. At the same
time everything seemed to wake up to meet it: the
old men who leant all day against the harbour wall
started out of their dreams to handle the ropes flung
to them from the steamer&#8217;s deck; the harbour master
and the factor of the company hastened along the
quay, and all the folk of the little town issued from
their houses and swarmed down to the water&#8217;s edge.
The whole Island of Oig roused itself from its six
days&#8217; peace, and began to bustle for its life.</p>

<p>Having taken fast hold of the pier with its rope tentacles,
the masterful black monster rapped out a
wooden gangway, down which there walked quickly
a passenger who looked as much estranged from the
surroundings as the floating machine which had transported
him from the mainland.</p>

<p>The strangeness was not so much in his black
clothes as in his gait and bearing. He walked jerkily,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
with short, quick steps, casting glances to right and
left through his spectacles, as though he were moving
through a crowd, on the lookout for hindrances.
His feet struck the ground in the helpless, violent
fashion of one who wore boots and used his feet merely
as the ferrules of his legs on the pavement, instead
of as claws to grasp the ground with. The muscles
of his neck had suffered a similar atrophy; a long
course of high collars and top-heavy hats had drilled
his head into a fixed pose, and it moved on the socket
of the neck stiffly and jerkily within certain narrow
limits. That his eyes had also become cramped by
gazing at books instead of fields and clouds was
shown plainly enough, for this man of the town wore
glasses. He had only to open his mouth to speak,
and you saw that his very teeth were no longer
Nature&#8217;s handiwork.</p>

<p>The townsman&#8217;s speech was as outlandish in the
Island of Oig as were his dress and gait. He stopped
half-way down the pier, before a group of boys, who
had left their play to come and see the steamer, and
put a question in English.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can one of you boys direct me to the house of
Mr. Duncan Gilderoy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, nearly everyone on the Island of Oig bore
the name of Gilderoy; and this was all the more noteworthy
because Gilderoy was not their real name,
but one which the whole clan to which the islanders
belonged had taken to hide their own, in order to
escape the enmity of other and more powerful clans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
on the mainland, which had sworn to wipe them out.
This wholesale exchange had taken place more than
three hundred years before, and only a few of the
very old islanders, living in the most out-of-the-way
corners of the isle, any longer remembered what their
real name was; and they were not believed by the
rest, because the story sounded so strange beside the
sober narratives of events told in the books written
by people in Edinburgh, and called the &#8220;History of
Scotland.&#8221; Therefore, though the <i>Pax Britannica</i>
was now established in Oig, the inhabitants still clung
to their cloak-name, so that all of them but those
whose families had come into the island since the
sixteenth century called themselves Gilderoy. And
of these Gilderoys every third man had been baptized
Duncan, because Duncan was the lucky name
of the island, and it was well known that if you were
baptized by that name you could not be drowned,
unless the nixies made a mistake;&mdash;though even that
was not known to the present generation, who had
been brought up on the Edinburgh books, and who
therefore thought they had their children baptized
Duncan because it was the custom.</p>

<p>So when the outlander put his question the boys
stood dumb at first, staring at him and wondering
at his stupidity. The invader on his part wondered
at theirs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you speak English?&#8221; he demanded crossly,
as though ignorance of that tongue were wrong in
itself, a sign of natural depravity which even the benighted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
heathen must know in their hearts they ought
to be ashamed of.</p>

<p>The boys seemed to feel the force of the rebuke.
They turned their eyes to one who stood in the forefront
of the little group, as if calling on him to defend
them. The leader answered instantly:</p>

<p>&#8220;What Duncan Gilderoy is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke the outlander&#8217;s tongue as easily as the
outlander himself, though each of them sounded his
words in a way that seemed a little strange in the
other&#8217;s ears. The man from the mainland crowded
his words in that habit of hurried speech which towns
beget. The boy intoned his words with a slight shrillness
caught from the winds and waves that battle
round the Hebrides. The boy had already learnt
from the stranger&#8217;s speech that he was an Englishman;
the Englishman thought he learnt from the
boy&#8217;s that he was not a Scotchman. To the Englishman
a Scotchman was a person who spoke the dialect
of old Northumbria. He had expected to find the
islanders of Oig speaking either Gaelic or the speech
of Burns.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you English?&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The boy flushed darkly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, and held his tongue.</p>

<p>This time the invader looked at him closer. He
was a handsome boy of eleven or twelve years of
age, tall, and rather slender, and although he wore
old, worn clothes, he did not look in the least humble
or ashamed of them, a thing which struck the Londoner&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
mind as reckless and a little bad. Below his
kilt of dark green tartan, variegated with stripes of
black and white, the boy&#8217;s legs and feet were bare,
like those of his companions. Above the kilt he had
on a shabby jacket of black velvet with tarnished silver
buttons, and a round bonnet set on the back of his
black curls made a frame for his face.</p>

<p>The man repeated his first question in another
form.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know Mr. Duncan Gilderoy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean Duncan Gilderoy of the Old House?
Or is it the minister?&#8221; asked the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not the minister. He is a farmer, and
they told me his house was just outside the town.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said &#8220;town,&#8221; because he had heard it called that
on the steamer. But his London eye called it &#8220;village.&#8221;
Two rows of squat houses struggling up
from the harbour&#8217;s edge to a small kirk just under
the ridge of the hill&mdash;that was all he could see.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then that is Duncan Gilderoy of the Old House,&#8221;
put in another of the boys.</p>

<p>The man turned to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has he a young gentleman living with him, named
Stuart?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>All eyes were turned to the boy who had been the
first to speak. This boy gave a distrustful, searching
glance at the stranger.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that is the Duncan Gilderoy you want, I can
take you to him,&#8221; he said, rather unwillingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, then.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>The other boys fell back, staring hard, as their
comrade walked off beside the man in the English
clothes. The man carried a small travelling-bag in
one hand, and before they had gone many yards he
offered it to his guide.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you like to earn a sixpence?&#8221; he said
pleasantly.</p>

<p>The boy flushed again and frowned angrily. Then
he stopped dead, and, turning round, shouted back
to the group they had just left:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Jock, carry his bag, and he&#8217;ll give you sixpence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jock proved to be the boy who had guessed which
Duncan Gilderoy the stranger wanted. He darted
from the rest, and ran up to seize the bag, and then,
having taken possession of it, fell in on the other side
of its owner.</p>

<p>The Londoner felt he had made a mistake of some
kind. The boy who had refused an offer of sixpence
commanded his respect. Gazing at him again, it began
to dawn upon him that this bare-footed young
Highlander carried himself with dignity, and that he
held up his head in a way that is not taught in Board-schools.
The next moment the boy, aware that he
was being studied, lowered his head with a defensive
instinct, and glanced at the man out of the corner
of his dark eyes. The glance was at once sly and
na&iuml;ve, like that of some bright, wicked bird.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is your name, my boy?&#8221; the Englishman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
asked, with a touch of middle-class patronage.
He could not quite get the bare feet out of his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Alistair Stuart.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger uttered a sound of surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Stuart who lives with Mr. Duncan
Gilderoy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; The answer came unwillingly again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are the boy I have come here for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew that,&#8221; said Stuart. And a slightly cunning
look came into his eyes.</p>

<p>The man was baffled. He could not quite make up
his mind whether the boy had been playing a practical
joke on him from the first, or had been merely
too dull to explain himself. Londoner-like, he leant
a little towards the second supposition, for he was
managing clerk to a firm of solicitors in Theobald&#8217;s
Road, and firmly believed that human nature contained
no depths which he had not sounded to their
very bottom. He believed that all men were animated
by one supreme motive, the making of money,
that they were distracted and impeded in their progress
towards the goal by the counter-attractions of
woman and wine, and that he was the wisest who best
withstood these allurements, and kept his gaze steadily
fixed on that yellow bull&#8217;s-eye of endeavour. He
regarded the law as the rules of the game, and knew
to a hair exactly how far it was possible to go without
breaking them. There was only one irrational
element in the man&#8217;s life: he was a Wesleyan, and
holding it for certain that the doctrine of that sect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
amounted to an immediate communication to himself
from his Maker, of whom he was a good deal afraid,
he paid in reluctantly but largely to the Church funds,
which he regarded as a species of blackmail levied by
God on business men.</p>

<p>The three walked up through the narrow street together.
The street was paved with cobble-stones, and
ascended in layers or great steps, with one or more
houses to a step. The houses themselves would have
been called hovels in London, and looking at them,
the law-clerk considered that he was walking through
a slum. He wondered almost mournfully how human
creatures could submit to pass their lives in such
miserable conditions. The sight of the bare-footed
lads and lasses with their red cheeks and shapely
legs woke actual pity in his breast; for he was naturally
kind, and his kindness could only find expression
in the benevolent wish to take control of all
these lives which he understood so little, and shape
them into the image of his own.</p>

<p>Stuart had been looking forward to the coming
of this man ever since he could remember. He had
always known that Duncan Gilderoy was only his
foster-father, and that his life would not be lived
out on Oig. They had told him that his father and
mother lived in France, and that his father was too
ill to have his children with him. He could not
recollect these legendary parents, who were only
known to him by portraits which he religiously cherished,
and by letters which came to him regularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
from his mother. His father, from whom he received
only occasional messages, was the object of
a devotion that filled his whole heart; his yearning
for that unknown father&#8217;s love was one of those passions
of childhood which are never told, and which
are never forgotten. There was more of awe than
love in his thoughts about his mother; she was an
Englishwoman, and the tenderness that her letters
expressed was overlaid with pious monitions and references
to Bible texts. He learned that he had an
elder brother, James, who was being educated at a
school in England under the casual supervision of
the head of the family, who had never noticed Alistair.
At some time or other&mdash;he was doubtful when&mdash;the
perception had come that the character of his
upbringing was at least partly due to lack of money.
The islands and moorlands, the castles and broad
acres that made up the great inheritance of Trent and
Colonsay were all tributary to certain men of law
in London and in Edinburgh, whom the clansmen of
Oig hated as a conquered nation hates the invader
encamped upon its soil.</p>

<p>Alistair knew also&mdash;for these things were the history
and politics of Oig&mdash;that his father stood next
in succession to the dukedom, and that his brother&#8217;s
favour with the reigning Duke was in right of his
exalted destiny as heir.</p>

<p>Thus the boy, reared in the society of herdsmen
and fishers, who were to him as kinsmen of a lower
rank, had had always before his eyes the vision of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
the great world in which he was one day to play a
part. Civilization shone for him afar off, as it shines
for the native of some colonial wilderness, in all the
hues of hope and wonder. How often had he climbed
to the top of the cliff that overlooked the Sound of
Oig, and laid himself down on the wind-mown grass,
looking and longing for the first peep of that sooty
feather which he had taken for the signal of emancipation.
No instinct had ever warned him that the
little noisy packet was a slaveship, the galley of the
great Anglo-Roman Raj, coming to make him captive,
and carry him off to be tamed and trained into a
citizen of the Raj, to speak its tongue and wear its
dress, and learn its manners, and its laws, till the
innermost pulse of his being should be timed to the
Anglo-Roman time, and the ancient Pictish blood in
his veins should forget its source, and run as if
through Anglo-Roman ducts.</p>

<p>Looking back across his life to this point of departure,
it seemed to Alistair that he had found the clue
of his tangled skein, and that he might in time achieve
a complete answer to the riddle of his fate. For a
moment the longing of his heart returned to that
green islet in its grey sea, and he bitterly regretted
that he had not been left to live out his life there
among the clansmen whom he loved, and by whom he
was beloved, who esteemed him as a prince among
them, and would have still esteemed and shielded
him had he become the outlaw of the Raj. He was
an exile&mdash;surely it was this, he told himself&mdash;he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
an outlander adrift amongst a race to which he did
not belong; which he never could understand, and by
which he never could be understood.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first great misunderstanding with his captors
had come when he was a boy. There was a Velasquez-looking
portrait on the walls of Colonsay House
of a lad of fifteen, long-legged and slim, with eyes
like the night&mdash;a night haunted by the slumber of
wild beasts that the first footfall will disturb. The
dress of this boy was touched with the girlish delicacy
that betrays a mother&#8217;s darling: the collar was
of lace, the jacket was of velvet, the straw hat, thrust
back from his forehead, was costlier than lace or velvet.
At night he slept in silk, in a tapestried chamber.
His days were passed within the stately walls,
or in roaming through the glorious demesne, of one
of the historic homes of England, watched over with
all the care that love and wealth could afford.</p>

<p>He had lived with his mother ever since his father&#8217;s
death. It was not until she had clasped him in her
arms that she had told him of his loss, and she had
never suspected the bitterness of the boy&#8217;s grief. The
father whom he had never known remained a sacred
memory still, all the more sacred because his mother
never talked to him about the dead. By this time
the old Duke was dead as well, and James had succeeded
him, so that the days of hardship were over,
and the inheritance was being nursed back into something
like its former splendour.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>A fond yearning to regain some of the lost years
of their childhood had caused their mother to keep
both her boys beside her, giving them a tutor instead
of a school. But she had another motive which she
tried to believe was paramount&mdash;the desire to bring
them early into her own religious fold.</p>

<p>During four years Alistair had had his mind
steeped day after day in the emotional atmosphere of
primitive Christianity. This was his mother&#8217;s native
air, and she could not have been brought to believe
that it might be drawn with difficulty and pain by
any human creature. If the knowledge had been
forced upon her that such a training was unwholesome
for either of her sons, her universe would have
become a maze without a plan; her God would have
been shattered like Dagon.</p>

<p>To both the boys this training came as part of the
yoke which age imposes on youth. Boyhood is always
surrendering its secret convictions at the bidding
of authority; the process called education is one
long defeat of the barbarians by the legions. Their
mother heard them repeat the phrases which she had
taught them, and believed in her work.</p>

<p>A cold temper and unimaginative mind enabled
the elder boy to take this religion in the formal spirit
in which it has been taken by a great part of mankind
for two thousand years. As a theory of the
universe it received his unquestioning assent; as a
life-motive it left him practically untouched. He became
the unconscious hypocrite whom the Gospel was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
written to make us loathe, and who has governed
the Church ever since the Gospel was written.</p>

<p>On Alistair his mother&#8217;s teaching had another effect.
A poet&#8217;s sensitiveness on the score of words
made him shrink at times from the familiar language
of his mother&#8217;s creed. But his temperament responded
readily to the exciting influence of religious
emotion, and the cunning which usually accompanies
hysteria taught him to use this faculty for his own
protection. When he had been naughty during the
day&mdash;and Alistair was already marked out as the
naughty one of the two brothers&mdash;it was his mother&#8217;s
habit to come into his room after he had gone to bed,
and try to soften him. She knelt beside the bed, and
talked and prayed with him till the boy melted in
a confession of wrongdoing, and the two made it up
with kisses and tears.</p>

<p>These scenes had endeared Alistair to his mother,
whose tenderness for her younger son aroused the
elder&#8217;s secret jealousy. They had been ruinous to the
boy himself, whom they made an emotional debauchee.
He spent his sincerity in spasms of repentance
which left him worse than before. There were
yet other consequences: the nervous organization is a
sensitive instrument, which ignorant fingers do not
touch for nothing.</p>

<p>For a year past Alistair had inspired his mother
with hopes that he was ripening for the change of
mind which she called conversion. He had become
more serious; his gaiety was sometimes dashed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
melancholy; he wrote verses which she treasured up
as evidences of the direction his intelligence was taking.
The verses were echoes of the poets whom she
had placed in his hands, and her favourite poets were
Miss Havergal and Dr. Bonar. He had taken to
wandering much by himself in the park; sometimes
on returning from these rambles he posed her with
strange questions about the nature of the Deity and
the contradictions that abound in every positive system
of the universe.</p>

<p>The mother drew happy auguries. Like Hannah,
she dedicated her son to the Lord, and wrote to the
Archbishop who was his godfather, to interest him
in the boy.</p>

<p>All this time one half of life had been carefully
hidden from Alistair. Of the great mystery of life
he knew less than an animal knows. For him, as for
all his generation, the divine lore which was once
communicated in solemn temples and amid consecrated
groves, which is still given the character of
a revelation among the worshipping millions beneath
the Himalayas, lay under the blight of the great
ascetic frenzy which spread round the Mediterranean
zone two thousand years ago. The temple had long
been a stew, the revelation a vulgar jest bandied about
on furtive lips; the groves were cut down, the torches
were blown out, the musical instruments were broken,
and the rite of initiation had passed from the holy
places into the sewers. The road of darkness was
esteemed the road of safety; and Alistair walked upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
it in ignorance alike of the law of Heaven and of the
taboo of man.</p>

<p>The Garden of Eden is like that flying island of
Arabian geography which descends unawares in front
of the adventurer, and tempts him to tread its enamelled
turf, surrendering his senses to the hymeneal
music of its birds, and the perfume of its myriad
flowers. The earth was changed for Alistair by a
keeper&#8217;s daughter, a girl of his own age, with a face
fair as an apple-blossom, in whose heart the seed
of ambition had been early sown by a vain mother&#8217;s
hand. All through one summer-tide they met by
stealth among the woods of Trent; while she, intoxicated
by the young lord&#8217;s notice, listened with uncomprehending
ears to that passionate romance which
youth pours out at the first touch of love: and for
him the sunshine sprinkled all the air with orange-blossoms
through the green network overhead, the
silver birch-stems rose like rejoicing fountains in the
glimmering shade, the hum of insects lapped his enamoured
ear like the vague music of a shell, the very
ground distilled a rapturous scent, and all his pulses
sang within him as his life swept into the great throb
of the universal world.</p>

<p>The retribution which followed on discovery tortured
him still in the remembrance. What such a
discovery must have cost a mother like his, he could
not gauge. He only knew that every sacred feeling
in his own breast had been outraged, the innermost
sanctuary had been profaned, the delicate blossoms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
had been uprooted and trampled in the mire. He
had a recollection of hideous scenes, of questions that
were intolerable insults, of a visit from the Archbishop,
who came too late to mediate, and, finally, of
a term of penal servitude passed in an institution
abroad, from which Alistair returned a Roman
Catholic.</p>

<p>In his mother&#8217;s eyes this was a moral bankruptcy.
Fresh influences were brought to bear on the perverted
one; the rest of his youth was passed in drifting
from one guardianship to another, under a perpetual
cloud, and manhood found him without faith
and without a career.</p>

<p>That his mother had loved him throughout Alistair
knew well, though even he did not know how much
she loved him. Perhaps the love between them had
been strengthened by the tragedy of the past. It
seemed to Alistair now to have been the old story
of the hen that has hatched out a duckling from the
shell. He thought of his mother with a painful mingling
of wrath and tenderness, believing her to have
been cruel to him, and knowing that she had been
cruel to herself for his sake. The mother whom his
instinct taught him to demand was one of those mothers
of the passionate races, who live only to be the
slaves of their sons, to hear their confessions, to
soothe their remorse, to abet them in their worst
crimes. His grievance against his own mother was
that she had not taken him for what he was. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
changeling had been tormented in the hope of giving
it a human soul.</p>

<p>When he came of age he took the problem out of
her hands. &#8220;You do not understand me,&#8221; he told
her one day; &#8220;I must live my own life.&#8221;</p>

<p>His brother, Trent, had granted him an allowance
of a thousand a year, which his tradesmen raised to
five thousand. The contents of every shop in London
were at the command of the brother of the Duke
of Trent and Colonsay, on condition that the brother
of the Duke paid double for them. The shopkeepers
began by cheating him, as though they foresaw
that he would end by cheating them.</p>

<p>Stuart hardly knew that he was extravagant. Most
of the ways in which he spent money were ways in
which he heard other men praised for spending it.
He collected miniatures; he bought old cabinets,
which were repaired for him by skilful workmen;
he published tiny volumes with his own poems, in
which a strain of southern passion mingled with the
dreamy melancholy of the northern seas. His pleasures
were those of a poet, not a man about town. He
lent money to those about him, to the poets whose
names were unknown to the readers of magazines,
to the painters whose pictures were abhorred by the
Royal Academy, to the musicians who could not make
bright tunes. Such men have no right to live; but
Stuart fed them at his table, and rejoiced in the incense
of their praise.</p>

<p>It was the difference between Lord Alistair Stuart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
and the men who surrounded him which had first
fascinated Molly Finucane. He had been for her
a mystery which she was bent on exploring. When
after a time she found that this intellectual side of
her lover&#8217;s character was out of her reach, she became
jealous, and sought to choke it. It was of such
as she that a certain acquaintance of Stuart&#8217;s in those
days wrote that all men kill the thing they love.</p>

<p>In her own way, and with what truth was left to
her, Molly Finucane did love Alistair Stuart. That
was the part of it which others could not be expected
to allow for. The life in the house in Chelsea had
been as regular as that of any married pair. The
only visitors received were Stuart&#8217;s friends. Molly
had discarded all her old associates as completely as
though she had been really married&mdash;always with the
exception of Mendes, whom Alistair sometimes asked
to dinner. She had practised what in her eyes was
economy, playing the novel part of housekeeper, enjoying
the strange experience of giving orders to
tradesmen, and calculating the prices of household
stuff. Unfortunately, she could not shake off at once
the habits of reckless expense which she had been
taught. Her nature had come to crave for excitement
as an opium-eater&#8217;s craves for the drug, and the
only amusements she knew were costly ones. The
play, for Molly, meant a brougham, a little dinner at
a smart restaurant, a private box, and a supper at
some Bohemian night-club&mdash;in short, the spending of
five or ten pounds. She went to the theatres and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
music-halls very often. On the nights when she did
not go she felt disastrously bored, and wished herself
dead. Then she had to have flowers every day,
and a new bracelet or some such trifle every week, or
she felt herself neglected. She had acquired the fatal
idea that the love of men was only to be gauged by
the money they spent on her. An unbroken stream
of these offerings was necessary to convince her that
Stuart had not tired of her.</p>

<p>In reality, it was the attempt to live within his
means which destroyed Lord Alistair&#8217;s credit. As
soon as his tradesmen heard of the house in Chelsea
they began to send in their bills, and as soon as the
money-lenders heard that he was paying his debts they
refused to help him. It was the Duke of Trent whom
they had trusted to, and now they recollected that
the Duke&#8217;s estates had come to him heavily mortgaged.
They told Lord Alistair to apply to his
brother, and his brother told him to leave Molly Finucane.
Like the rest of the world, he believed that
it was the house in Chelsea which had brought his
brother down.</p>

<p>Alistair had retorted by filing his petition. It was
to be open war at last, he told himself. If the head
of his house would not heed him, neither would he
heed the honour of the house.</p>

<p>And now, as he stood on the bridge and gazed at
the spectacle of the night, it was borne in upon him
more fully and more clearly that he was not without
companions; that his case was not a solitary case, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
that other houses besides the house of Trent and Colonsay
had their younger sons and their failures; that
other lands besides Oig had given their children to
be devoured by the minotaur called Civilization; that
his was only one of those broken lives which underlie
the pageantry of empire, like the rubble underneath
rich palace walls.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He turned once more to regard the spectacle of the
night, and his eye swept over the two edifices that
confronted each other immediately above the bridge,
the palace, and the hospital; the chosen of the race
gathered in the one, its victims in the other, as if
civilization were an army whose headquarters and
whose ambulance stood side by side. His eye rested
long where the road leading down into the dark purlieus
of poverty and crime flared and roared like the
mouth of sheol; then it returned to the northern side,
where the roof of a great mansion was just visible
above the trees.</p>

<p>What he saw there was the form of a grey-haired
woman seated alone, thinking of her prodigal son,
perhaps praying for him, perhaps expecting him. He
threw one last backward glance towards the city of
Ahriman, and then, with a shudder, he set his face
towards the gates of Ormuzd, and walked swiftly off
the bridge.</p>

<p>All the time he had been standing there a prayer
had been going up to Heaven: &#8220;Give me back my
son, O Lord! Give me back my son!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />


<small>THE PRODIGAL SON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Alistair</span> walked past the lights of Palace Yard,
and turned into the broad avenue of Parliament
Street, bordered by the vast offices of the British Empire.
When he had gone half-way to Charing Cross,
he turned aside again, and presently found himself
in front of a high and sombre house, one of a row
whose windows overlooked the river and the bridge.
It stood back in a bleak garden enclosed in tall iron
railings, where nothing grew but grass and trees and
ivy, all of the same shade of soot-encrusted green.
This was Colonsay house, a relic of the days when
the Thames had been a glorious highway between the
cities of London and Westminster, a highway lined
with the dwellings of great nobles, and bright with
painted barges and fluttering banners.</p>

<p>Now a slight air of decay hung over the old house,
and it seemed conscious that it had outlived its generation.
The tide no longer washed the foot of its
lawn, and rich brocades and jewelled sword-hilts no
longer sparkled under its trees. It stood there with
its few neighbours, isolated among the encroaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
buildings of a newer age, and waiting its own turn
to be devoured.</p>

<p>Stuart hesitated for a moment as he stood outside
the door. There had been a time when he would
have walked through that door as of right. But it
was long since he had lived under his brother&#8217;s roof,
and more than a year since he had passed this doorway
last. During the time that he had been living
in Chelsea he had shunned all intercourse with his
family. His mother had written to him more than
once, but her letters had remained unanswered. The
letters were entreaties to him to abandon the woman
who was dragging him down, and he had not abandoned
her.</p>

<p>He raised his hand to the bell, and jerked it roughly.
Then he stood waiting, half ashamed to encounter
the gaze of his brother&#8217;s servants, and resenting
their curiosity in advance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the Duke in?&#8221; he asked of the man who opened
the door. He had no wish to meet his brother that
night.</p>

<p>In the first moment the footman did not recognize
his questioner. The next his face lit up with an expression
of respectful sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my lord; his Grace is at the House of Lords.
But will your lordship come in?&#8221;</p>

<p>As he threw the door wider the butler, an old family
retainer, stepped forward. His face wore the
same expression as the footman&#8217;s, a little less subdued,
and he ventured on a word of welcome.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>&#8220;I hope I see your lordship well? Her Grace is
upstairs, and I believe would be very glad to see your
lordship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, Stokes,&#8221; said Stuart shortly, giving the
footman his hat and stick. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The servants fell back with faces of demure congratulation
as he passed between them to the foot of
the staircase. It was evident that they viewed this
home-coming of the prodigal as the pleasant and appropriate
ending to a deeply interesting history.
Perhaps Lord Alistair&#8217;s transgressions had aroused in
their breasts a secret fellow-feeling such as they could
never have for their upright, decorous master. The
conduct which had disgraced Lord Alistair in the
eyes of his equals had made him a hero in theirs. Disgrace,
after all, is a relative term; what is ignominy
in the schoolroom is often glory in the playground.</p>

<p>Alistair reached the first floor, and took his way
to the well-remembered little drawing-room, where
his mother always sat when she was alone. Tapping
softly on the panel, he opened the door and went in.</p>

<p>It was an old-fashioned room with narrow Georgian
windows, and the walls were decorated with
painted panels, set in elaborate gilt scrollwork, with
small tail-pieces underneath, in the style of an Italian
altar-piece. A picture of sportsmen in a coppice was
completed by a dead pheasant below, and a sea-piece
was similarly finished off with a group of shells. In
contrast with this eighteenth-century elegance the furniture
was of that ungraceful, stereotyped pattern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
which has not yet been out of date long enough to
be esteemed for its curiosity. It was the work of
an age which valued the useful above the beautiful,
and preferred the accurate production of machinery
to the irregular handiwork of the craftsman. It was
the age of the political economists, when Free Trade
was the gospel of humanity, and the world&#8217;s ideal
took shape in a huge bazaar. It was an age in which
England ruled the world, and the shopkeeper ruled
England, and men deemed that the millennium could
not be far away.</p>

<p>The religion of this age was Evangelical Christianity.
The work of Wellesley and Whitefield still leavened
the national life from the cottage to the throne.
The Catholic conspiracy had not become formidable;
the rising tide of knowledge had not yet sapped the
foundations of the old beliefs. A miscellany of Hebrew
literature, half savage, half sublime, bound up
with the cryptic legends of the Roman catacombs, and
rendered into English by the intellect of the sixteenth
century, was accepted as the personal composition of
the Creator, inspired, infallible, and irrevocable, from
the first letter in the word <i>Genesis</i> to the last in the
word <i>Amen</i>. Salvation by faith was the watchword
of the Churches; the unbeliever was assured that his
best actions were but additional sins until he had gone
through that spiritual experience which brought him
within the pale of the redeemed.</p>

<p>Yet this strait, remorseless creed educated women
who were gracious and beautiful in their lives, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
of such women Caroline, Duchess of Trent, was one.
She accepted her creed, as the scientist accepts the
law of cause and effect, without understanding it, but
her logic was able to reconcile it with hope and charity,
and with a tireless devotion to the good of all
about her.</p>

<p>They who are willing to sacrifice themselves will
never want those who are willing to accept the sacrifice.
In her girlhood Caroline had been a maid of
honour in the Court of Queen Victoria, and she had
ever since been one of that small circle whom the widowed
monarch counted as her personal friends. The
needs of selfish parents had forced her into an early
marriage with a sickly old man whom she nursed
faithfully and kindly, but whom she could not love.
He died before she was thirty, leaving her with
enough wealth to attract Lord Alexander Stuart, the
penniless younger son of a great but impoverished
house.</p>

<p>To this man, as handsome as he was worthless,
she gave her heart and her fortune, in accordance
with the common law which mates the best with the
worst, and he had become the father of her children
before she made the discovery that he was an irreclaimable
drunkard and gambler. For their own
sakes she consented to part with her children, and
she passed the next ten years of her life in accompanying
the man to whom she believed herself bound,
from Continental hotel to hotel, keeping up a hopeless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
struggle against the vices which were dragging
him down to the grave.</p>

<p>Her loyalty, and perhaps some relic of her love,
survived him, and no word of hers had ever betrayed
his memory to his sons. In the face of the younger
she found a resemblance to his father which had insensibly
gained on her affection, and although she
had tried to disguise it from them, and from herself,
both the boys soon knew that Alistair was their
mother&#8217;s favourite. When the courtesy rank of
Duchess was conferred on her by royal patent, she
did not value the distinction for herself, but her
mother&#8217;s heart felt a secret pride that her handsome,
naughty Alistair should be given the style of Lord.</p>

<p>The catastrophe which opened her eyes to the
meaning of heredity rendered her frantic with grief
and shame. That likeness between Alistair and his
father which had fascinated her for so long now became
a source of terror. The handsome boyish face,
with its ruddy cheeks and bright eyes and clustering
curls, which had gladdened her sight, was now a
dreadful chart in which she read prophecies of evil
to come.</p>

<p>Under the stress of panic she took that step which
she had since bitterly regretted, which had cost Alistair
his religion, and had cost her his confidence. Ever
since that miserable time mother and son had remained
apart, gazing at each other wistfully across a
chasm which neither could bridge.</p>

<p>The life which he had been leading since his manhood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
seemed to her a dangerous, if not an evil one.
She saw him moving in a world which was wholly
strange to her, a world in which her own ideals of
conduct were ignored or despised. She heard that
he had written poems which she was advised not to
see. Trent told her they were unfit for any decent
woman to read, and the Archbishop added that they
were blasphemous. When she ventured on a remonstrance
with Alistair he replied by telling her that
art was above morality, and that a poet must be a
law unto himself.</p>

<p>Like all the mothers of her generation, she would
fain have shut her eyes to one side of her son&#8217;s life.
But even she could not help but hear of such a portent
as Molly Finucane. The Archbishop felt it his duty
to warn her. Trent openly complained that his
brother was disgracing the family, and threatened to
forbid him the house. He might have carried out
the threat if Alistair had not ceased his visits of his
own accord.</p>

<p>By this time sorrow had helped her sixty years to
make the Duchess an old woman. Her figure was
still upright, but her hair was silvered. Her face,
at once sweet and venerable, was marked by a settled
sadness. Her elder son had been as great a comfort
to her as his brother had been a trial, and she had
learned to value him more and more. Yet not all
her pride in Trent&#8217;s career could soothe her inward
grief and yearning over the marred life of the son
who had gone astray.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>Alistair came in softly, and found his mother in
tears. At the sound of his footstep on the threshold
her face flushed, and she rose up, breathing fast, and
went quickly to meet him, with a great joy shining in
her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;My boy!&#8221; she cried hysterically. &#8220;My boy
Alistair!&#8221;</p>

<p>They stood there silently for a space, with their
arms round one another&#8217;s necks, and both felt comforted,
for these two loved each other very tenderly,
and they had not met for a long time.</p>

<p>Such moments do not last. The first gush of affection
spent, they were left face to face, two natures
belonging to different worlds.</p>

<p>While Alistair led his mother to a seat he asked
anxiously:</p>

<p>&#8220;When is Trent likely to be back? I don&#8217;t want
to see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess looked troubled.</p>

<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t be in till late, I expect. He is introducing
a Bill in the House to-night, and he told me
not to sit up for him. I think there is another debate
on first, about the Church.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair heard her listlessly. The doings of the
House of Lords sounded in his ears just then like
the fretting of phantoms on a stage. He had struck
his foot for the first time against reality. What does
anyone know of life who has never risen in the morning
wondering under what roof he shall lay his head
at night?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>&#8220;But you ought to see him,&#8221; the mother went on
to say. &#8220;He is your brother&mdash;neither of you should
ever forget that. You want his help, dear, and I am
sure he will help you if you will only let him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He should have helped me before,&#8221; Alistair returned
in a resentful tone. &#8220;I know Trent; he would
not lift a finger to save me from being hanged unless
he were afraid of what people would say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be bitter,&#8221; the mother pleaded. &#8220;Your
brother means well by you, I am sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense, mother; he would be only too glad to
get rid of me altogether. I have always been a
thorn in his side. He looks upon me as the
black sheep of the family, and always will. Trent
would like to pack me off to the Klondike for the next
ten years, I expect.&#8221;</p>

<p>As this was one of the suggestions which had actually
fallen from the Duke&#8217;s lips that day, when the
news of his brother&#8217;s insolvency had been brought to
the house, the Duchess found it difficult to answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Klondike would be better for you than the life
you have been leading here,&#8221; she said as gently as she
could. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it would be better for you
to leave London and go abroad for a time out of the
reach of temptation?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man frowned. He knew very well what
was meant by the word &#8220;temptation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t go without money,&#8221; he said shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could let you have a little, dear, and James, I
know, will let you have as much as you want, as long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
as he knows that it won&#8217;t be spent&#8221;&mdash;she hesitated an
instant&mdash;&#8220;in bad ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair scowled.</p>

<p>&#8220;What business is it of his how I spend my
money?&#8221;</p>

<p>His mother raised her hand with a certain quiet
dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is my business, at all events, to know what kind
of life my boy is living, and to sorrow when I know
that he is living in open sin and shame.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this speech Alistair made no answer. He could
have made none that would not have added to his
mother&#8217;s pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much do you want?&#8221; the Duchess asked
presently in a weary tone. It was not the first conversation
between them that had ended at the same
point.</p>

<p>The young man started up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, mother, I didn&#8217;t come here to ask for
money; I&#8217;m past that now. It doesn&#8217;t matter to me
whether I stay in London or go abroad. Trent can
decide for himself about that. Anyway, I must go
under for a time, I suppose, and I don&#8217;t much care
if I ever come up again. I was out on Westminster
Bridge just now, wondering whether it wouldn&#8217;t be
the easiest way to drop over, and put an end to it all;
and then I thought of you, and felt sorry for your
sake more than my own; and so I made up my mind
to come and see you&mdash;and here I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor lady shook a good deal as she listened to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
this speech; and, remembering her prayer just before
Alistair came in, she breathed a silent thanksgiving,
and the tears came back into her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my poor boy, can&#8217;t you see that all this is
the result of the life you have chosen!&#8221; She would
have liked to make a more direct reference to her
religious belief, but feared to do so. She had learnt
by this time that her son and she had no common
ground in that direction. &#8220;Why&mdash;why don&#8217;t you
leave that wicked woman, and start a new life? She
is ruining you, body and soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair frowned impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t let you say that, mother. It&#8217;s not her fault,
Heaven knows! The poor little thing has tried to do
her best for me. She is a great deal better than
some of your good women, who would draw their
skirts aside if they passed her in the street.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke roughly, but not disrespectfully.</p>

<p>The Duchess sighed heavily.</p>

<p>&#8220;My unhappy boy, you know nothing about good
women. You never meet them; you might be a different
man if you did. If I could only bring you
under the influence of some really good, devoted girl,
such as I know&#8221;&mdash;a name rose to the Duchess&#8217;s lips,
but she deemed it wiser not to pronounce it at that
moment&mdash;&#8220;who would love you well enough to overlook
the past, she might redeem you even now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair sighed, too, at the picture called up by his
mother&#8217;s words. He thought of poor little neurotic
Molly, with her spasms of utter wretchedness, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
hysterical fits, her occasional drunken outbreaks in
which all the gutter in her blood came to the surface;
he thought of her perpetual, feverish craving for excitement,
of her secret hatred of his intellectual pursuits,
of their ill-managed, disorderly household, with
insolent servants going and coming every month. And
then he contrasted the portrait with that of some
sweet and gracious maiden&mdash;such a girl as his mother
must have been in her youth&mdash;who would bring peace
into his life, whose presence would be soothing as the
sound of church bells heard at evening across the
autumn fields, who would guide and rule their home
through happy years of wedded friendship. Alistair
sighed.</p>

<p>His mother heard and drew courage from the sigh.
Already her mind was busy in working out a scheme
for her boy&#8217;s salvation. Her eagerness led her to
make a false step at the outset.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will go away even for a short time I shall
feel happier,&#8221; she pleaded. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you try to separate
yourself from this woman? If you like to go
abroad I could come with you, perhaps. You have
often said that you should like to visit Rome?&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair shook his head stubbornly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot go away without Molly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess of Trent flushed. It seemed to her
that this answer was an insult, even though she had
in a manner forced it from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder that you dare say that to me,&#8221; she said,
with a touch of anger.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>&#8220;I beg your pardon, mother. But it&#8217;s no good
our discussing such things. I can&#8217;t expect you to
understand how I feel about her. She has given up
everything&mdash;you may say she has reformed&mdash;for my
sake, and if I were to send her adrift now I should
feel myself a blackguard. Why, God help me, I believe
the poor little thing&#8217;s been selling her jewels to
pay the housekeeping bills for the last few months.
If she&#8217;d been my wife she couldn&#8217;t have done more
than that.&#8221;</p>

<p>His mother started, and a look of dreadful apprehension
came into her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk like that, Alistair! I&#8217;m getting old,
and it frightens me. Promise me, promise me, my
own dear son, that you will never <i>marry</i> her?&#8221;</p>

<p>In her agitation the poor lady rose and went to him,
laying a pleading hand on his shoulder as she looked
into his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t suppose I shall ever do that,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>But he spoke in a tone of dejection, like a man
not certain of himself, and the mother&#8217;s fear was not
relieved.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<small>A FAMILY COUNCIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Duke of Trent and Colonsay, after shaking
hands with the Prime Minister, and receiving the
congratulations of several colleagues on his first appearance
as a Minister in charge of an important
measure, was walking out of the House, when he felt
himself tapped familiarly on the shoulder from
behind.</p>

<p>He turned round in some annoyance, for he was
careful of his dignity, but the look of rebuke was
exchanged for one of respectful pleasure as he perceived
that the hand which had touched him was the
Duke of Gloucester&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going back to Colonsay House?&#8221; the
Prince inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>was</i> going,&#8221; the Minister returned, conveying
by the change of tense that his movements were for
the Prince to dispose of.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right; then I&#8217;ll walk round with you, if
I shan&#8217;t put you out,&#8221; Prince Herbert said, linking his
arm in friendly fashion in the Duke&#8217;s.</p>

<p>The two companions were old acquaintances; they
might almost be called friends. They had been boys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
together, in so far as a Prince is allowed to be a boy.
Their houses were in the same part of the country,
and the cordial relations between the Duchess Caroline
and her royal mistress had been renewed by their
descendants.</p>

<p>At that time, indeed, Prince Herbert had been more
intimate with Alistair Stuart than with James. The
younger boy&#8217;s merry, versatile disposition had made
him a favourite, while his brother was rather a dull
companion. But the course of their later lives had
tended to keep up the intercourse between the Prince
and the Duke, while Alistair had gradually drifted
away into paths in which it was impossible for his
royal friend to keep him company.</p>

<p>The new Home Secretary expected to receive some
compliment as they passed out under the vast vault
of the Victoria Tower and turned eastward. His
speech that night had been a marked success. The
Bill he had just introduced was one to provide the
punishment of flogging for the gangs of street-boys
who infested the southern side of the river. He had
denounced the enemies of order with conviction, and
the House had cordially endorsed his righteous anger.
No one had been weak enough to think, or bold
enough to suggest, that there was any better way to
deal with the hooligan than to flog him. There had
been a time when England could export her savages
to savage lands, but, by some wonderful political alchemy,
no sooner did she cast her convict colonies
on the shores of America and Australia than they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
rose up mighty states, and with the zeal of renegades
refused to harbour the next criminal generation.
Even the army, so long the last refuge of the blackguard,
was become respectable. Science was already
lifting a confident voice to preach extermination for
the unfit, and society, puzzled between the old creed
and the new, found itself too weak to crucify, but not
too weak to scourge.</p>

<p>It was with a sense of disappointment that the
young Minister found that their walk was to be a silent
one. The Prince said nothing till they were in
Colonsay House.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose the Duchess is not up so late as this?&#8221;
the Prince asked, as they entered the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother generally goes on about this time,
but I will ask. Stokes, go and see if her Grace is
in her room, and if so tell her his Royal Highness
has asked for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke led the way into a Japanese smoking
lounge which opened off the stairs. A large bow-window
revealed the panorama of the night-enchanted
river, the reflections of the bridge lamps veining the
tide with molten gold.</p>

<p>Prince Herbert walked to the window and gazed
out speechless for several minutes, during which his
host strewed a lacquered table with cigars of a rare
brand, named after the Prince himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;The grandest view in Europe, I always think,&#8221;
the Prince observed, as he turned reluctantly from
the window. &#8220;And yet there is something dreadful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
in it. It is so utterly removed from Nature. It
makes one think of the underground life which we
are told the race will one day have to take to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have taken to it already, it seems to me,&#8221;
Trent answered. &#8220;We travel underground, our light
and water come to us underground, our food is
cooked underground, and I am told there are underground
stables in some parts of London.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prince Herbert closed his lips as he walked across
to choose a cigar. It was not the first time that he
had found James Stuart a heavy person to talk to.
He could not help comparing this commonplace mind,
with its prim grasp of daily life and its impotence to
rise to any higher plane, with the brilliant and sensitive
imagination of Alistair, like a soaring bubble,
one moment glowing with the reflected radiance of
a thousand stars, the next moment smashed against
the coarse paling of the roadway.</p>

<p>Yet it was this man who enjoyed honour and favour,
while the other was become an outcast. It was
to this man that he himself was about to sue for some
toleration of the other.</p>

<p>He had just struck a light when the door opened to
admit Alistair&#8217;s mother. With the quick instinct of
sympathy she had divined the object of the royal visit,
and she pressed a warm kiss on the Prince&#8217;s forehead
as he came forward to greet her.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear aunt,&#8221; he exclaimed, using the title which
he had given her in his boyish days, &#8220;I hope you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
haven&#8217;t come downstairs on my account. I ought to
have gone up to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would much rather sit here, and see you smoke,&#8221;
she said, with an affectionate smile. &#8220;That is, if an
old woman is not in the way of two young men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prince Herbert hastened to draw forward a chair,
but the Duchess refused to sit down till the visitor
had lit his cigar. As soon as some servants who
had brought in a tray of spirits had left the room, the
Prince opened his appeal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry about Alistair,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>A frown passed quickly over the Duke&#8217;s face at this
allusion to the family trouble, but his mother looked
up gratefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was sure you would be,&#8221; she responded. &#8220;Poor
foolish boy! If only I could find a way to save him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t this have been prevented?&#8221; inquired
Prince Herbert, glancing at the elder brother.</p>

<p>James shook his head decisively.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was impossible. My mother will tell you I
did everything I could. Twice I have got him to give
me an account of his debts, and settled them, as I
thought. But I don&#8217;t believe now that he ever let
me know one half of what he really owed. It is like
pouring water into a sieve to try and help Alistair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know what the amount is now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifty or sixty thousand, I understand. I don&#8217;t
suppose he knows within ten thousand or so himself.
It is two years&#8217; revenue of the property. Everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
is entailed; I can only mortgage my life interest, and
that means paying a heavy premium for life insurance.
Ever since he came of age I have given him
a thousand a year, and of course he could have his
rooms here if he chose to lead a decent life. My
mother knows that that is the very utmost I can do
for him if I mean to keep up the estates as they ought
to be kept up. I have to think of a jointure for my
wife, if I should ever marry, and some provision for
my own children.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke delivered his defence in an injured tone,
as though he felt that the sympathy of his audience
was against him. Prince Herbert, in his quiet way,
returned to the attack.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have really no right to ask you, but I should
have thought your properties brought you in a great
deal more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are still heavily encumbered,&#8221; was the answer.
&#8220;There are mortgages on nearly everything
except the Scotch land, and that brings in nothing.
I might let the moors, I suppose, but in my opinion
that would be another disgrace. I am very strongly
opposed to giving these Americans and stockbrokers
the pick of all the historic places in Great Britain. I
blame Cantire for letting Mull.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time the Duke spoke with undisguised
warmth. It was a relief to him to silence the misgivings
from which his own mind was not entirely
free on the subject of Alistair.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>&#8220;After all, I owe a duty to my people, as well as
to Alistair,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;I am the head of the
clan as well as the landlord. I regard myself as a
constitutional monarch on my own estate, and I have
no right to sacrifice my tenants in order to enrich
Molly Finucane.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prince Herbert felt himself rebuked. He doubted
no more than others that the house in Chelsea had
been Alistair&#8217;s undoing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there no hope of rescuing him?&#8221; He looked
hesitatingly at the Duchess.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have just seen Alistair,&#8221; she confessed, not without
some fear of her elder son&#8217;s resentment. &#8220;He
came here to see me to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To ask for money, I suppose,&#8221; said the Duke.</p>

<p>The Duchess was wounded by the taunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;He did not ask for any, and I did not give him
any,&#8221; she said with dignity. &#8220;I told him I was sure
that you would help him if he would only leave that
woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did he say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he meant what he said; I can&#8217;t think
so. But he talked about her in such a way that for
a moment I thought he wanted to marry her.&#8221;</p>

<p>A fierce exclamation broke from the Minister, a
milder one from Prince Herbert.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he does that, he shall never have another
farthing from me; I will never acknowledge him
again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His infatuation for her is terrible,&#8221; the mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
went on. &#8220;He even defended her to me. He told
me that she had made sacrifices for him&mdash;that she
was paying for the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men exchanged glances. This was a deeper
depth than either of them had suspected. Perhaps
the Duchess would have suppressed this part
of her information if she had understood how it
would strike a man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there no chance that the woman herself may
give him up now?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess shook her head doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think not, from what he says. I hardly
know what it is best to do. I think perhaps he might
be induced to give an undertaking not to marry her,
in return for some assistance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Home Secretary made a face of disgust.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I am to be blackmailed, am I? I have to bribe
my brother not to make a street-girl the next Duchess
of Colonsay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prince Herbert looked distressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure that is the right way to go to work
with Alistair?&#8221; he asked gently. &#8220;I have always believed
that there was good in him, you know. Perhaps
if you tried to appeal to his generosity you might
do more than you suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair&#8217;s mother gave the speaker a grateful look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Bertie. It is very good of you to
plead for my poor boy. I think, James dear, you
may have been a little harsh with him sometimes.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>&#8220;If you were to go to him now,&#8221; the Prince pursued,
&#8220;not to scold him at all, but just to say, &#8216;Well,
old fellow, you&#8217;re in a mess; let&#8217;s see if I can get
you out,&#8217; I think you would find him very different
to deal with.&#8221;</p>

<p>The elder brother still frowned.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know Alistair as well as I do. He
would most likely insult me. The last time I wrote
to him, nearly a year ago, enclosing his allowance,
and pointing out to him how the life he was leading
was bound to end, he wrote back to me&mdash;my mother
saw the note: &#8216;Dear Jim, your cheques are better than
your sermons. Affectionately, Alistair.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Prince Herbert by a severe effort checked the smile
which rose to his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all, he is your brother,&#8221; he reminded the
aggrieved senior.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know why he should be,&#8221; the
Duke muttered, but he let his voice drop at the sight
of his mother&#8217;s sorrowful face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would see him myself,&#8221; the Prince added, &#8220;only
I have to leave for Birmingham to-morrow to lay
the foundation stone of a cathedral, and I am under
engagements which will keep me in the district for
several days.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess rose and walked across the room to
where her son was seated, tapping a fretful foot upon
the floor. She laid her hand on his arm, and looked
him beseechingly in the face.</p>

<p>&#8220;My son, my eldest son!&#8221; she murmured softly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
&#8220;You need not be jealous of the poor prodigal. Say
that you will go?&#8221;</p>

<p>And James said that he would go.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That night Alistair&#8217;s mother did not sleep.</p>

<p>The bankrupt himself slept heavily after emptying
a bottle of champagne, at whose expense he no longer
hesitated. The new Minister tossed to and fro till
the excitement of debate had evaporated, and then
sank into a calm, health-giving slumber. Prince Herbert
slept too; if he had passed a troubled night the
wires would have flashed the news next day from
Auckland to Vancouver.</p>

<p>But the Duchess of Trent could not sleep. She
spent a night of fear and sorrow, her mind haunted
by the terrible word that spelt the wreck of her darling&mdash;the
word <i>wife</i>.</p>

<p>Rather than see her son married to Molly Finucane
she could have prayed that he might be taken
from the world. To her apprehension such a marriage
meant ruin final and irretrievable, ruin social,
moral and religious, ruin in this life and the next.</p>

<p>As the first streak of dawn slanted through the
window the poor lady crept from her bed, and throwing
a dressing-gown round her shoulders, sat down
at a small writing-table to write a letter.</p>

<p>She began by addressing the envelope, with fingers
that shook partly from cold and partly from anguish:
<i>Miss Finucane, Elm Side, Chelsea</i>.</p>

<p>She had made up her mind to take the desperate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
step of writing to Molly Finucane to implore her not
to marry Alistair.</p>

<p>She had first entertained the idea of going to Molly
to make the appeal in person, but she had found herself
unable to face the reception which she feared was
possible. Molly Finucane&#8217;s reputation daunted her.
The courage of this gentle, pious, pure-minded
woman was not great enough to brave the scoffs of
a girl whom common fame reported as more foul-mouthed
than a bargeman.</p>

<p>The letter took a long time to write. The words
came slowly, and more than once the writer felt inclined
to drop the pen in despair. But at last it was
finished.</p>

<p>The letter ran like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>:</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you pardon the liberty I take in addressing
you? I write on behalf of my son Alistair. I
hardly know how to express myself without seeming
unkind, but you will understand what a shock it has
been to his mother to see him in the Bankruptcy
Court. He was here last night, and from what he
has said to me I feel sure that you do not wish him
ill. His only chance of salvation is an entire change
of life, and that can only be brought about by your
influence. The tremendous hold you have over him
is my only excuse for appealing to you like this. I
have no doubt you see as clearly as I do how his
present life is likely to end&mdash;in misery and distress.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
Nothing I could do would be too much to show my
gratitude if you would consent to let his friends extricate
him from his present way of life, and give
him a fresh start. He is still a young man, and unmarried,
and therefore we hope it is not too late to
save him. If you are really his friend you will yourself
be anxious to do nothing that would drag him
deeper down into the abyss. In his present state of
mind I fear for him; he is hardly master of his actions,
and might be led in a thoughtless moment to
take some step which he could never recall. It is
even possible that he might contemplate marrying
you, which&mdash;forgive my saying so&mdash;would entail certain
misery on you both. He would lose all his
friends, and as soon as the awakening came he would
regard you as his bitterest enemy, and the cause of
his ruin. I hope you will not resent my speaking thus
plainly; I need not say I do so solely out of the natural
anxiety of a mother for her boy, and not out of
any desire to say anything harsh or unkind toward
you personally. Most earnestly I implore you, I appeal
to you in the name of your own mother, to let
me save my boy! With many apologies for thus addressing
you, believe me,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">&#8220;Yours very sincerely,</span><br />

&#8220;<span class="smcap">Caroline Trent and Colonsay</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The letter finished, the Duchess betook herself to
her praying-closet, where she remained till her maid
appeared.</p>

<small>BEERS COOPERAGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Duchess of Trent would never call the little
chamber which she used for her devotions an oratory,
thinking that term savoured of Romanism. The
furniture of the praying-closet was as downright and
old-fashioned as its name. There was a little table
against the wall, supporting a plain cross of silver,
a Bible, a Book of Common Prayer, a small book of
devotions called Bogatzky&#8217;s &#8220;Golden Treasury,&#8221; containing
portions of Scripture, with hymns and prayers
for each day. An armchair and a kneeling-cushion
were the only other articles in the closet, except
on the walls, which were hung with a few illuminated
texts of Scripture, and a fine engraving of one of
Holman Hunt&#8217;s pictures. It was such a room as
might have been used by the pious Countess of Huntingdon,
or one of those saintly dames who kept alive
the lamp of Evangelical Christianity through the
days of the Regency.</p>

<p>Here the Duchess was accustomed to spend many
hours in pious meditation. Her nature was inclined
to the tenets of the Quakers, but, like the royal mistress
whom she had formerly served, she deemed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
questions of ecclesiastical forms and government were
unimportant, provided they did not come between
the soul and its Maker. Her horror of Romanism
had its root in the natural strength of her character;
she revolted from the devotional practices of that
communion as a healthy man might revolt from the
use of crutches. Her education had taught her to
consider that the claims of the Roman Church were
a deliberate imposture, but she was too charitable
to think evil of the individual members of its priesthood.
The great wave of medieval reaction which
was now sweeping over the English Church, and in a
lesser degree over the Nonconformist bodies, had
passed her by. The ecclesiastical subtleties which had
exercised the mind of Newman and his followers were
meaningless to her. She lived, as she humbly believed,
in direct communion with God, whose Holy
Spirit afforded her what light was necessary to salvation,
and the Sacraments she regarded as mere outward
tokens of a spiritual allegiance.</p>

<p>Believing thus, her piety overflowed, not in the
observance of fasts, nor in attendance at public services,
but in works of benevolence. In the country
parish where she had formerly lived she had discharged
all the duties of a curate, except those connected
with public worship. The cottagers believed
in her more than in the Rector; on several occasions
she had been asked to baptize some new-born infant
whose little life seemed to be guttering out. Those
of such children who survived were regarded as singularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
blest, and their parents showed great reluctance
to let the ceremony be repeated in the church
with the proper forms. She had been in still greater
request as a peacemaker; no quarrel ever outlived her
interference in that office. Yet she never scolded the
people, and seldom rebuked them. Her method was
to take the causes of mutual offence upon herself, and
ask forgiveness from each in turn. It became imprudent
for her to speak severely to any of the villagers,
even when rebuke was called for. She found out
once that a drunkard whom she had sternly reproved
for ill-treatment of his children was set upon in consequence
by the entire village and beaten dangerously.
Her removal to London was felt like death. The
whole country-side was downcast. She arranged to
keep up the payment of all her alms by the hands
of the Rector, but this was not felt as a consolation.
Half the population of the parish followed her on
the day she went away from them, the mothers crying
and holding up their babes to take a last look at
her, the children silent and hanging their heads. The
fathers at work in the fields cast down their tools as
the carriage went by, and came and stood in the road,
with bared heads, till it had disappeared.</p>

<p>Afterwards the Rector, himself a well-meaning but
dull man, meeting one of the men on his way home,
said that he was glad to see so much love shown by
the people for her Grace.</p>

<p>The man stared at him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>&#8220;Us love she, sir? Why, that&#8217;s nought. &#8217;Twere
her as loved we, sir, better than us love each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the Duchess settled in her son&#8217;s London
house, she sought at once for the spot where such
service as hers was most needed. She did not apply
to the minister of the parish in which Colonsay House
was situated, lest, tempted by her great rank, he
might exaggerate the claims of his own district, and
perhaps push out some humbler worker. For though
every Calvinist is something of a republican, and the
Duchess of Trent made it a point of conscience not
to set value on the title she bore, a wise prudence
taught her never to forget the importance attached
to it by others, and the unwholesome influence it was
likely to have over a certain class of minds. She
knew how to distinguish with perfect clearness between
the courtship paid to her rank and the love
which she inspired on her own account; in this respect
again resembling the monarch who was her friend.</p>

<p>After a careful investigation, carried out quietly by
herself, the Duchess chose for her sphere of charitable
labour a district lying in the south of the
Thames, between Lambeth and Westminster Bridges.
Here, under the shadow of the Archbishop&#8217;s Palace,
she found heathendom as utter as, and vice more rank
than that the Church was sending out missionaries to
cope with in China and Hindustan.</p>

<p>The Vicar of the parish in which this region was
included, whose name was Dr. Coles, was a pious,
learned, and zealous divine, but he was believed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
construe his ordination vows according to a code of
honour more Roman than English. The services at
St. Jermyn&#8217;s bore little resemblance to those of a
Protestant place of worship, and it was suspected that
they were but the outward and visible signs of a still
deeper cleavage between the Doctor&#8217;s private beliefs
and those affirmed in the articles of religion which
he had subscribed. The Vicarage was the resort of
a great number of young men from the theological
colleges, among whom the Vicar of St. Jermyn&#8217;s appeared
to enjoy an authority not explained by his rank
in the Church.</p>

<p>Being a man advanced in years, and not being able
to afford more than one curate, Dr. Coles was glad
to avail himself of the services of helpers from outside
the parish. Most of these were women of wealth
and position, who came from their homes in the fashionable
quarter to minister to the dwellers in the back
streets of Lambeth. The reader of the society paragraphs
in the daily press sometimes little suspected
that the women whose names he saw in the list of
guests at a grand dinner-party or dance the night before
had spent their morning going about the slums
of St. Jermyn&#8217;s.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Trent and Colonsay went to work
without fuss, calling herself at the homes of the poor,
and winning an easy entrance by her own kindly and
modest demeanour. The sullen drudges of these dark
precincts soon learned to look for her coming, not
as that of a patroness, but as that of a dear friend,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
who was interested in the small details of their daily
lives, and ever ready to sympathize if a drunken husband
overnight had left a black bruise on the poor
thin arm, or a ne&#8217;er-do-well son had been sent to the
cells for fighting in the streets. They never knew
how closely their own stories often tallied with the
experience of the lady who listened to them so wistfully,
and who found in soothing their sorrows the
means of living down her own.</p>

<p>It was to this district that the Duchess took her way
on the morning after she had seen her son.</p>

<p>The carriage set her down at the corner of a small
street, called, as if in mockery of a more splendid
region, Little Bond Street. Walking down this street,
where she was well known, and nodding pleasantly to
those of its inmates who were at their doors, the
Duchess presently came to a small court or yard,
which bore on the wall of the archway opening out
of the street the legend &#8220;Beers Cooperage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beers Cooperage no longer retained any trace of
the manufacture of casks and barrels which some departed
cooper had doubtless carried on there in bygone
days. It consisted of a row of half a dozen very
small cottages, with still smaller enclosures in front,
which looked as though they might once have been
meant for gardens. A last reminder of the time when
Beers Cooperage had considered itself to be in a rural
neighbourhood lingered on the window-sills of
some of these cottages, which were ornamented with
miniature wooden railings and five-barred gates, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
touch of rustic fancy of which the modern Londoner
has become incapable. Yet though the inhabitants of
Beers Cooperage could not have originated these
quaint decorations, and had probably never seen the
country sights they were meant to recall, they took
a pathetic pride in possessing them, and as soon as
one of the railings or gates showed signs of decay it
was carefully repaired.</p>

<p>Who knows what influence such trifles have over
all of us? It is certain that the dwellers in Beers
Cooperage were generally quieter and more decent
in their lives than most of their neighbours. One or
two of them kept singing-birds, instead of terriers to
kill rats with. The inmate of one house, a poor cripple,
had even set himself resolutely to make his front
garden a reality instead of a name, by planting a
row of wallflowers, bought full-grown from a coster-monger,
in what he evidently considered a bed. These
plants, which perished periodically, and were regularly
renewed, were regarded with reverence by the
neighbours, and attracted pilgrims to view them from
two or three streets away. But on the rare occasions
when they burst into bloom of their own accord, no
profane hand was allowed to come too near them.
After being reverently smelled at a distance by the
dwellers in the Cooperage, the blossoms were culled
with anxious pride by their proprietor, and made into
a nosegay for the Duchess, who carried them home
with her, and set them on the table of her oratory.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
They were the only flowers ever seen on that simple
altar.</p>

<p>There was one house in Beers Cooperage, however,
which differed strikingly from the rest. This
was the hovel at the upper end, where the yard terminated
in a high blank wall. There were no five-barred
gates on the window-sills here; nothing but
fragments, which hung rotting over the edge. Half
the panes in the window were broken, and stuffed
with dirty scraps of paper. The paling before the
house was also fast disappearing, and the space in
front was littered with broken tins and refuse not
sufficiently noisome to attract the notice of the sanitary
inspector. In the corner stood a kennel tenanted
by a mongrel bulldog, the terror of the small
children in the Cooperage. The door of this cottage
generally stood half open, and through it came
all day and night long sounds of angry scolding, or
of oaths and drunken yells. The inside of the place
matched with its outside. The floors and stairs
looked as if they were never washed; the germs of
a dozen fevers might have lurked in the dirt which
was thickly piled everywhere. The miserable crockery
and kitchen stuff was in as deplorable a condition
as the windows. The bedding chiefly consisted of
heaps of unwashed rags.</p>

<p>This was the one house in Beers Cooperage into
which the Duchess had never yet ventured to go. It
was tenanted by an Irishman, who had threatened to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
wring the neck of any &mdash;&mdash; Protestant who came
meddling inside his doors.</p>

<p>For the last fortnight the Cooperage had enjoyed
a blessed spell of relief from the presence of this man,
whose formidable strength, added to his choleric temper,
rendered him the terror of his neighbours. He
had been taken in the act of kicking an old man whom
he had first knocked down. The magistrate before
whom he was brought, who had just previously imposed
a sentence of six months on a boy for the theft
of a pair of boots, desirous, perhaps, to show that
he could be merciful on occasion, sent the hooligan
to prison for fourteen days, thereby releasing the
rest of the inhabitants of Beers Cooperage for that
exact length of time.</p>

<p>On this morning, as soon as the Duchess came out
from under the archway which formed the entrance
to the Cooperage, she saw that something was amiss.</p>

<p>Several of the cottages showed broken windows,
and in one or two places even the cherished gates and
rails had been damaged or destroyed. A broken birdcage
lay on the ground in the far corner of the yard
beside the dog&#8217;s kennel. All the doors of the houses
were closed, except the Irishman&#8217;s, through which
shrill screams were issuing. Lastly, the poor lame
gardener was standing in his little plot disconsolately
regarding the wreck of his cherished flowers, which
looked as though they had been trampled over by a
regiment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mike Finigan done it,&#8221; he explained, in answer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
to the Duchess&#8217;s sympathetic exclamation. &#8220;&#8217;E got
outer prison yisterday, and &#8217;e come in drunk lorst
night with &#8217;is crew, and played old &#8217;Arry all over the
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>As if the presence of the Duchess had instantly
become known, by what is called mental telepathy,
to every resident in the Cooperage, all the other doors
were thrown open, and the women crowded about
her, recounting the tale of the Irishman&#8217;s misdeeds,
and denouncing their author. The owner of the
broken birdcage pointed to it, not without a certain
melancholy pride in her pre-eminence of wrong.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;E broke it &#8217;isself, and &#8217;is mates killed my bird;
and there I&#8217;m going to let it lie till I &#8217;aves the law of
&#8217;im, the roughing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whether the woman believed that the continuance
of the broken cage on its present spot would be a
strong confirmation of her story, like the bricks in
Jack Cade&#8217;s chimney, or whether she had some obscure
feeling like that which causes a Brahmin creditor
to starve himself to death, in a spirit of revenge,
on his debtor&#8217;s doorstep, and considered the wrecked
cage as a talisman which would work harm to the
wrongdoer, she failed to explain. But the threat of
legal proceedings was not taken seriously by her
neighbours, the inhabitants of Beers Cooperage regarding
an appeal to the constituted authorities with
much the same feeling as schoolboys do a complaint
to a master. The poor have an instinct which teaches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
them that the State is their enemy; they are a subject
population within the borders of the Raj.</p>

<p>While the group round the Duchess were still shrilly
vociferating, evidently with the object of making
their reflections reach the ears of the Irishman in his
retreat, they were interrupted by the appearance of
two figures in the mouth of the archway.</p>

<p>One of these new-comers was a man, the other a
girl of nineteen or twenty. At the sight of the first
the Duchess of Trent frowned slightly, but her face
brightened again as she caught sight of his companion,
whom she had come out this morning in the secret
hope of meeting.</p>

<p>There is a type of womanhood known all over the
world as English, and in that bright and gracious
type Hero Vanbrugh was completely moulded. It is
not a type of classical perfection, like that associated
with the Roman virgin; it does not cast that intoxicating
spell over the passions of men which Southern
poets mean by love. The Southern language has no
word for this type; it is only the dear old Northern
names of maid and sweetheart and wife which express
its tender charm.</p>

<p>Hero Vanbrugh, as she stood framed in the archway,
was a picture to gladden the eyes. It was not
only that her features were delicately chiselled, and
her body a harmony of slenderness and strength;
there were men who declared that at some moments
she seemed to them to be actually plain; but the freshness
of the rain was in her face, and the laughter of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
the wind in her hair, and the blue breath of the sea
in her eyes, and there were other men to whom at
many moments she seemed the fairest sight that they
had ever looked upon.</p>

<p>The dress which she wore was of that unpretending
serviceable pattern which would have been deemed
almost masculine a few years before. In the eyes
of a man the simple coat with its white collar, and
the plain skirt, might have appeared homely, but the
eye of another woman would have been quick to note
the marks of an artist&#8217;s hand in the cut of each garment,
and would have credited the wearer with perfect
taste, coupled with the means to gratify it.</p>

<p>The man who stood beside her in the archway was
as unlike her as it was possible to be.</p>

<p>If Hero Vanbrugh might have been taken as a type
of all that was best in English humanity, the same
could scarcely have been said of her companion. Big
and bull-necked, with coarse, flushed features, small,
deep-set eyes, and a round fleshy chin, he might have
passed, in a different dress, for a comrade of Mike
Finigan himself. His costume would have marked
him out in any other country as a Roman priest. He
wore the shovel hat, with a long brim projecting before
and behind, which is associated with the stage
priest of comic opera, and his whole figure, from the
neck to the ankles, was enveloped in a long black
robe of design similar to that worn by Noah and his
family in the toy arks. The priests of Rome in this
country being in the habit of adopting a dress corresponding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
with the character of that worn by the people
among whom they live, this outlandish disguise
served to indicate that the wearer was in Anglican
Orders. He was, in fact, the Rev. Aloysius Grimes,
curate of St. Jermyn&#8217;s parish.</p>

<p>The Rev. Aloysius was one of that class which has
flowed into the ranks of the clergy of late years in
increasing numbers, to fill the gap created by the falling
off in the supply of graduates from the Universities,
a falling off due as much to the decline in the
value of the Church&#8217;s preferments, perhaps, as to the
decline of belief in her doctrines. The son of a small
tradesman in the suburbs, he had passed from a
higher-grade Board School into a theological college.
He had entered the college an ordinary sharp London
lad of the lower orders, and left it the social equal
of dukes.</p>

<p>Such a youth, strongly conscious of the importance
of the step he had gained, was not likely to listen
with reluctant ears to any doctrine which exaggerated
the dignity of his profession. The Rev. Aloysius
came out into the world firmly impressed that he
was a priest, commissioned by the Maker of the Universe
to teach and to rule mankind, endowed with
power to bestow the absolution and remission of sins,
and supernaturally enabled to work the awful miracle
of Transubstantiation.</p>

<p>Between the Duchess of Trent and Mr. Grimes
there was an instinctive antagonism, which each strove
to veil beneath the outward forms of courtesy, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
Duchess because she respected the curate&#8217;s cloth, the
curate because he respected her Grace&#8217;s rank. To the
Duchess the doctrines held and taught by the Rev.
Aloysius were simply and literally blasphemous fables
and dangerous deceits. She supposed that they
had been abandoned as such at the Reformation, and
she understood them so to be condemned by the Articles
of the English Church. Yet she perceived that
they were now freely tolerated within its pale by those
to whom the government of the Church was committed,
and she shrank with real pain from setting up
her own judgment against that of the Episcopal
Bench.</p>

<p>What added to her distress was the fact that she
was unable to credit the head of that Bench with
any belief in what she had always regarded as the
cardinal doctrine of Christianity. That doctrine in
her mind was the Atonement. The great truth which
Catholicism images in the crucifix seemed to her the
central one of Christianity, and those who doubted
it became in her view mere Deists, with a reverence
for Jesus of Nazareth. Such a Deist she believed
Dr. Dresden, the then Primate, to be, and, believing
it, she regarded even the Rev. Aloysius as more worthy
of his place in the Church than the Archbishop.</p>

<p>Mr. Grimes glided in front, fawning over the hand
of the Duchess, before Hero could come up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so delighted to meet you here, Duchess. It
is so good of you to do so much for our poor people.
They are always singing your praises.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>The Duchess made the briefest response to these
compliments as she turned to greet Hero.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, how well you are looking! One would
think that St. Jermyn&#8217;s was a health-resort, to see
you. Now I wonder whether you will take compassion
on a poor old woman, and let me carry you home
to lunch with me presently?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hero blushed as she listened to these old-fashioned
compliments.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are exceedingly kind, Duchess. I shall be
delighted. I came here in the brougham to-day, so
that I shall be able to send a message to my father
to let him know where I am. But what is all this
about?&#8221; She turned to the excited women who were
now repeating the tale of Mike Finigan&#8217;s outrages
in the ears of Mr. Grimes.</p>

<p>The Rev. Aloysius was listening with a troubled
brow. In his secret heart he had a great respect for
Finigan, partly because he knew that the Irishman
had no respect at all for him, and regarded him as
an impostor, dressed in plumes borrowed from his
own clergy, partly because of the superior example
which the Finigans showed to his own flock in the
matter of reverence for the priesthood. The hooligan
and his family in their wildest moments treated
their own priest as being invested with dreadful sanctity
and tremendous powers. They firmly believed
that Father Molyneux could strike any one of them
dead without moving an eyelash; if one of them had
been betrayed into lifting a hand against the Father&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
person, they would have expected to see it wither to
a stump. Yet Father Molyneux was a very insignificant-looking
little man, with a jolly smile, and a
brogue like the scent of an onion, who went about
dressed in a shabby overcoat and a disreputable hat
of the ordinary chimney-pot shape. He said &#8220;Sorr&#8221;
to Mr. Grimes when that gentleman condescended
to greet him in the street, and never showed by a
word or look that he did not regard him as a superior
by whose notice he was honoured. It was true
that the little priest had a reputation for humour
among his own friends; a sound as of laughter was
sometimes heard issuing from the presbytery as the
Rev. Aloysius passed by; a book entitled &#8220;The Secret
History of the Romish Conspiracy&#8221; had been found
by the priest&#8217;s housekeeper in the cupboard where his
reverence kept his whisky and his slippers; but those
things were mercifully hidden from the curate of St.
Jermyn&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Mr. Grimes turned towards Hero, as she came forward,
shaking his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s a sad business, Miss Vanbrugh.
Finigan has broken out again. I can&#8217;t understand
how it is that a man so well conducted in some respects,
with such genuine faith in his religion, schismatic
though it may appear to us, should be guilty of
outrages like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hero flushed up. She did not share the elder
woman&#8217;s deep-rooted prejudice against the Catholicizing
movement, which attracted her strongly on its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
&aelig;sthetic side, but her English common sense remained
to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man is a drunken brute, who ought to have
been sent to penal servitude for fourteen years, instead
of being let off with a paltry fourteen days!&#8221;
she exclaimed. &#8220;What are prisons for, I should like
to know, except to protect peaceful folk from ruffians
like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Rev. Aloysius shook his head doubtfully. He
was inclined to read the text, &#8220;Thy faith hath made
thee whole,&#8221; in a very broad sense, and to consider
that Mike Finigan&#8217;s admirable loyalty to his creed
ought to atone for any trifling disregard of his neighbours&#8217;
peace and comfort.</p>

<p>But the inhabitants of Beers Cooperage, whose
rude minds failed to appreciate the beauty of Mr.
Finigan&#8217;s theological attitude, in the face of their
broken flower-pots and slaughtered pets, were quick
to perceive that Hero was the champion of whom
they stood in need. They deserted the curate to besiege
her with their complaints; the owner of the
birdcage renewed her direful malediction, and another
woman, who could boast no injury on her own
account, drew the sympathetic young lady to the scene
of the trampled wallflowers.</p>

<p>The sight aroused Miss Vanbrugh&#8217;s wrath in real
earnest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a great mind to send for the police myself,&#8221;
she declared. &#8220;I only wish I had seen him do
it, so that I could give evidence.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>The women shrank back at these words. Their
anger against Finigan, already partly relieved by the
mere exertion of denouncing him, was cooled at once
by Miss Vanbrugh&#8217;s threat.</p>

<p>&#8220;That &#8217;ud only mike it wuss, miss,&#8221; the lame man
responded dolefully. &#8220;&#8217;E&#8217;d come out again at the
end of a week like a mad Calico, an&#8217; not leave a roof
over our &#8217;eads.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Hero had time to resolve this extraordinary
expression into an allusion to the late Khalifa of the
Soudan there was a stir among the little group behind,
caused by the sudden appearance of Mike
Finigan himself at the door of his abode.</p>

<p>Now that the women perceived that their clamour
had achieved its purpose of rousing the evildoer, they
suddenly became silent. Finigan lounged forward,
with a masterful air, his hands in his pockets, and
surveyed his neighbours disdainfully.</p>

<p>It said, in the history-books out of which the small
Britons of Beers Cooperage were taught in the Board
School, that Ireland had been conquered by England
in the year of grace 1172. The history-books said
nothing about the conquest of Beers Cooperage by
Mike Finigan.</p>

<p>Seen close at hand, the Irishman did not look a
remarkably vicious or ill-disposed creature. His face
was of the dark, heavy, animal type to be met with
in some of the western counties of England itself.
He represented that mixed remnant of old, forgotten
races which is found washed up in out-of-the-way corners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
of the land, the relics of prehistoric wanderings
and subjugations, the rubble of European man.</p>

<p>Because his ancestors during a thousand years or
so had spoken a Gaelic dialect, learned language-mongers
called Mike Finigan a Celt. His name might
have told them that he was a mongrel Finn, between
whom and the fair-haired, blue-eyed Gauls who took
Rome there was no more kinship than between the
Chinaman and the Greek. The traditions of his own
land, had the language-mongers cared to study them,
would have disclosed to them the existence of half
a dozen strange older races, some of whom in all
likelihood were still speaking Neolithic dialects of
their own when the armies of C&aelig;sar landed in
Britain.</p>

<p>This primitive savage had been brought from his
native bogs, and set down among a peaceable town-dwelling
population, chiefly of Dutch descent, by the
economic machinery of the Raj. The Raj had taught
him to speak its language, and bestowed upon him a
voice in the choice of its administrators.</p>

<p>Now the Raj was trying to digest Mike Finigan.</p>

<p>In his own country, dwelling on some bare hillside
beaten by the rains of the Atlantic, the Irishman
might have seemed a picturesque figure. Living the
life that was natural to him, digging his native peat,
and finding an outlet for his brutal instincts in the
folk-fights that formed the immemorial pastime of
the country-side, he would have been a harmless
subject.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>In the streets of London he was a dangerous criminal.
The civilized life brought out all that was worst
in this wild nature. It galled him with its manifold
restraints. It stunned him with its monotony of work.
It teased him with its decorum. It stifled him with
its lack of air and space. Finally, it drove him to
the public-house.</p>

<p>If dirt be matter in the wrong place, so is crime
conduct in an unfit historical or geographical environment.
If the hooligan had lived a few thousand
years earlier he would have been a hero. He would
have refreshed himself with his native mead before
going into battle, and his strength becoming as the
strength of ten, he would have been deemed of supernatural
birth. His exploits would have become the
theme of bards, divine honours would have been rendered
to his memory, and, his figure shining through
the mist of saga like a demigod&#8217;s, learned students
would have been engaged to-day in identifying him
with the solar orb.</p>

<p>As it was, Mike Finigan&#8217;s history was already written
to its end. After a long or short series of savage
atrocities, after wounding and maiming a certain
number of peaceable citizens, and being punished by
sentences ranging from a small fine to six months&#8217;
hard labour, according to the magistrate before whom
he happened to be brought, one of Mike Finigan&#8217;s
kicks some day, probably by pure accident, would
cause a death; when society, seizing the excuse for
which it had been waiting all along, would hang Mike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
Finigan. A pity that you could not have passed the
sentence before the murder, and commuted it to transportation,
back to the little shieling in the potato-patch
from which you dragged his father, Your Majesty
the public!</p>

<p>The effect of alcohol is different on different constitutions,
a truism which fanatics forget. On Finigan
its effect was to make him a raging wild beast.
His unfortunate neighbours would have been the first
to bear witness that when the drink was not in him
the Irishman was harmless enough. His speech was
always coarse, and he was a stranger to soap and
water, but those were venial faults in the light of his
drunken frolics. At such moments the appearance
of the Khalifa himself in their archway would have
struck less consternation into the dwellers in the
Cooperage than Mike Finigan&#8217;s.</p>

<p>After one of these outbursts the Irishman was usually
sullen and silent for a day or two, during which
period his neighbours found it wisest to leave him
alone. He was in that condition, surly, but not dangerous,
as he strode forth to silence his assailants.</p>

<p>At the sight of the Duchess he paused, uncertain.
Though he had uttered a coarse threat against any
Protestant who should invade his own home, he had
acquired a tacit respect for the quiet lady who visited
his neighbours, and perhaps there were times when
he would not have been sorry if the Duchess had disregarded
his words, and included his wife and family
in her friendly ministrations. A secret shame at having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
disgraced himself in her eyes caused him to assume
a defiant and insolent air as he demanded of
the women:</p>

<p>&#8220;And what have yez got to say agin me, now I&#8217;m
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>The women shrank back terrorized.</p>

<p>The Duchess thought it useless for her to speak.
But Mr. Grimes, anxious to show her Grace how well
he could administer a priestly reproof, rashly undertook
to answer the bully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder you are not ashamed to ask the question,
Finigan. You have been behaving in a shocking,
scandalous manner. Do you consider what disgrace
you bring, not merely on yourself as a man, but on
the Church to which you belong?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Irishman turned red.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Mister, yez lave me Church alone, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll
lave yours,&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>The Rev. Aloysius smiled at the success with which
he had touched the man&#8217;s weak spot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not blaming your Church,&#8221; he said impressively.
&#8220;The teaching you have received is good
enough for you to know when you have done wrong.
I am pointing out to you that your neighbours here,
who do not know and understand the Church of
Rome as I know and understand it, are not likely
to have their opinion of it raised by such conduct as
yours last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The curate was warming to his work, and would
have gone on to inflict further stabs on the sensitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
place, when suddenly the Irishman clenched his fists,
and stepped towards him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say another word about me Church, good or bad,
and, be the Howly Moses, I&#8217;ll knock yer teeth down
yer Protestant throat!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Rev. Aloysius fairly recoiled, stunned, to do
him justice, as much by the insult conveyed in the
description of himself as a Protestant as by the threat
of personal violence. It was too bitter; the serpent
of schism had raised its baleful crest, and stung him
in the very midst of his flock.</p>

<p>Fortunately, or unfortunately, no one suspected the
true cause of his agitation. Before he could frame
a suitable retort an unexpected ally came to his rescue.</p>

<p>Hero Vanbrugh had listened impatiently to the
curate&#8217;s attempted admonition of the hooligan. Her
indignation at the brutalities whose effects she had
just seen was still hot within her, and the Irishman&#8217;s
hectoring demeanour made it boil over.</p>

<p>She walked up quickly, and confronted him with
blazing eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You coward! How dare you stand there and
bluster! How dare you come out and show yourself,
in the face of all the mean, silly, brutal, wicked things
you did last night! Where is the bird you and your
friends killed? There is its cage! Look at it, and
stay here and brazen it out if you dare! Look at
that poor man&#8217;s flowers all trodden down and broken!
I wonder you can bring yourself to pass them! To
rob a poor lame man! a cripple! I suppose you will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
beat him next, or murder him if you are not afraid
of the police. I tell you, you are a coward, nothing
but a big hulking coward, who goes about bullying
women and children&mdash;and cripples! Go! Don&#8217;t stay
out here! Go and hide yourself, lest a man should
come along and see you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then a great thing happened. For Mike Finigan,
the tyrant of Beers Cooperage and the terror of the
police, raised his finger to his forelock, and with a
muttered&mdash;&#8220;Beg pardon, miss,&#8221; turned round, and
shrank back into his house like a thoroughly ashamed
man.</p>

<p>The Duchess turned to Hero with a look of grateful
admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did that splendidly, my dear. Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The women, relieved of the presence of their enemy,
would have burst out in a triumphant chorus,
but Hero restrained them with a gesture, and the
next minute they were surprised to see her turn white
and totter against the side of the Duchess, who hastened
to draw her away.</p>

<small>THE WHOLE DUTY OF WOMAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the two ladies passed under the archway from
Beers Cooperage into the street they were followed
by Mr. Grimes, anxious to efface the rather humiliating
figure he had cut in his encounter with Mike
Finigan.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if we may have the honour of seeing
you at our bazaar this week, Duchess?&#8221; he said
smirkingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What bazaar is that? I don&#8217;t think I have heard
of it,&#8221; the Duchess responded, with indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Legitimist bazaar&mdash;to obtain funds on
behalf of the cause,&#8221; the curate explained.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Trent knitted her brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I don&#8217;t understand. What cause is
that, if you please?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Rev. Aloysius faltered somewhat in his speech
as he answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the cause of the legitimate monarchs who
have been excluded from their thrones by&mdash;ah&mdash;popular
insurrections, and&mdash;ah&mdash;constitutions and republics,
and so on. The Duke of Orleans is one of our
principal objects,&#8221; he went on rather hurriedly, observing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
a significant frown come over her Grace&#8217;s
brow at the word constitution&mdash;&#8220;rightfully Louis
XIX of France; and then there is Don Carlos of
Spain, and the Duke of Cumberland, and others.
Many of us consider that the Bishop of Rome has
been wrongfully deprived of his sovereign rights by
the House of Savoy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any more?&#8221; asked the Duchess, with some scorn.
&#8220;I shall be glad to know whether you consider the
Queen as a usurper, because I have served in her
household as a girl, and I have no desire to conspire
against her in my old age.&#8221;</p>

<p>The curate of St. Jermyn&#8217;s cast down his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I dare say there are a few members of the
Guild who hold, in an academical spirit, of course,
that the elder branch of the Stuarts are entitled to
our allegiance, but that is really more a pose than
anything else. No one intends the slightest disrespect
towards Queen Victoria. But the French Republic
is very different; its intolerance towards the religious
orders must make every Christian wish to see its
downfall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid that I do not sympathize with your
views sufficiently to care to come to your bazaar,&#8221;
the Duchess said dryly. &#8220;It appears to me that Legitimism,
according to your account of it, is another
name for Roman Catholicism, and I am a Protestant.&#8221;
The Rev. Aloysius looked pained. &#8220;Besides,&#8221;
her Grace went on severely, &#8220;even if this nonsense
about the Stuarts is only a pose, as you say, it seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
to me in very bad taste. I only trust it is not actually
treasonable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Grimes bit his lip. Then he put on a touch of
bravado as he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry you should think so harshly of us,
Duchess. I should not have ventured to broach the
subject, only Lord Alistair Stuart is among our patrons,
and we hope to see him on Saturday. Miss
Vanbrugh also held out a hope that she might drop
in for an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was only coming out of curiosity, remember;
I told you that, Mr. Grimes,&#8221; put in Hero promptly.
&#8220;As it is, I think I shall follow the Duchess&#8217;s lead,
and boycott you. I have no objection to Louis XIX,
but I think I must draw the line at Mary III.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was under this name that the Bavarian Princess
whom the Legitimist Guild honoured with their homage,
figured in their recently published calendar of
true and lawful Sovereigns. It must not be supposed
that in so styling her the Legitimists were inconsistent
enough to acknowledge the title of the wife of
William of Orange to a place in the list of British
monarchs. The Mary II recognized by them was the
ill-starred rival of Queen Elizabeth. Further back
than the martyr of Fotheringay their genealogical
inquiries did not too curiously extend, lest, perhaps,
they should find themselves confronted with that direct
descendant of the Plantagenets who plied the
trade of a chimney-sweeper in the last generation,
and who, as a base Protestant mechanic, would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
been ill-deserving of the sympathy accorded to such
illustrious figures as Don Carlos and Leo XIII.</p>

<p>But a change had come over the face of the
Duchess while Hero was speaking. Now she said to
her:</p>

<p>&#8220;After all, I expect it is a mistake to treat Mr.
Grimes&#8217;s friends seriously. Suppose we agree to look
in on the conspirators together? I should like you
to meet my boy Alistair.&#8221;</p>

<p>And without waiting for the expression of the
curate&#8217;s exuberant delight at this decision, the elder
woman gave the signal to enter the carriage that was
to convey them to Colonsay House.</p>

<p>On the way thither the Duchess made no further
reference to what was in her mind. But while they
were waiting for lunch to be served, she took her
guest into the little drawing-room where Alistair had
found her the night before.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to talk to you about my boy,&#8221; she said,
making Hero sit down beside her on the couch. &#8220;I
dare say you know he is in sad trouble just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was by no means Hero&#8217;s first visit to Colonsay
House. The friendship between her and the Duchess
was of some standing. Encountering each other
among the squalid byways of St. Jermyn&#8217;s parish, a
mutual liking had quickly sprung up between them,
which rested on no more occult base than the simple
goodness of heart which was common to the two.
The older woman admired Hero Vanbrugh for her
courage and plain good sense, and Hero on her part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
revered the Duchess for her antique piety and single-mindedness.
Thus it came about that the two were
constant companions, visiting in the same district and
helping in each other&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>It was a source of secret regret to the Duchess
that Hero did not share her own old-fashioned prejudice
against the Catholic practices and teachings of
Mr. Grimes and his Vicar. Hero had an &aelig;sthetic
appreciation of the ritual of St. Jermyn&#8217;s, with its
banners and processions, its incense and its worship
of the consecrated elements, and this led her to listen
with outward tolerance to the utterances of Dr. Coles
and his disciple on the subject of the Catholic doctrines
which lay behind these outward symbols. But
the native strength of her mind forbade her to make
that surrender of her own judgment to priestly
authority which is the real test of the Catholic
temper.</p>

<p>Perhaps this obstinacy was due more largely than
she suspected to the personal antipathy inspired in
her by the Rev. Aloysius. A young woman&#8217;s religion
is generally coloured by her personal relations with
the man who is her religious teacher; and Hero secretly
despised Mr. Grimes as a man, though she
tried to respect him as a clergyman. A suggestion
from the curate that Miss Vanbrugh would derive
spiritual benefit from a visit to his confessional had
been so discouragingly received that he never ventured
to renew it.</p>

<p>The curate did not help himself in Hero&#8217;s eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
by his rather too evident admiration of her as a
woman. If he had not been vowed to celibacy it
might have been supposed that he was courting her;
and even as it was, there were jealous eyes, belonging
to older and plainer women in the St. Jermyn&#8217;s
flock, which watched him with distrust, and jealous
minds which dwelt upon the fact that Anglican vows
of celibacy are a poor security. Perhaps it is not
doing much injustice to Mr. Grimes to suppose that
there were moments when he himself recollected
with some satisfaction that in his Church such vows
resemble the treaties of civilized Powers, and are
liable to be repudiated the moment they become
inconvenient.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, it is certain that Hero Vanbrugh
was heart-whole as far as her clerical admirer
was concerned. Lord Alistair Stuart she had never
met, her intimacy at Colonsay House dating since
the separation due to Molly Finucane.</p>

<p>She was familiar with Lord Alistair&#8217;s story, in so
far as it had become a social scandal, but this was
the first time his mother had pronounced Alistair&#8217;s
name in her presence, and her interest was strongly
roused.</p>

<p>She gave the Duchess a nod of sympathy and
understanding.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw what had happened in the papers. I was
very sorry. It must have been a great blow to you
and to the Duke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a crushing blow,&#8221; the mother answered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
&#8220;Not only in itself, but because of what lies behind
it. My boy would never have come to this if he
had not fallen under the influence of that dreadful
woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>In saying this the poor mother spoke quite sincerely.
In spite of Alistair&#8217;s disclaimer, in spite of
her own experience with him in the past, she could
not bring herself to forego the mother&#8217;s consolation
of laying her darling&#8217;s sins upon another&#8217;s shoulders.
In the eyes of a true mother the whole world is full
of wicked men and women busied in laying snares
for the destruction of her child; she never deems it
possible that her child may be himself the tempter
of others.</p>

<p>Hero did not doubt that the Duchess spoke perfect
truth. What woman likes to think that another
woman&#8217;s influence is otherwise than hurtful to a man
in whom she is interested?</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure of it,&#8221; Miss Vanbrugh said with conviction.
&#8220;But perhaps what has happened&#8221;&mdash;they
both shrank from the word &#8220;bankruptcy&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;may be
the best thing in the end, if it compels him to leave
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess shook her head despondently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly know what will happen yet. I hinted
that his brother might come to his help if he would
give up his present life, and he refused. Do you
know what I am actually afraid of? I believe that
woman is scheming to make him marry her!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hero Vanbrugh was as much shocked by this suggestion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
as the Duchess could have desired. Her training
had not been severely Puritanical, but an instinct
older than copybooks and Sunday schools taught her
to look on Molly Finucane as her natural enemy.
Such women as Molly were traitors to their sex; they
were the blacklegs of the feminine trades-union. The
wage which the others had worked from time immemorial
to establish&mdash;honour, a home, the half of
all a man&#8217;s possessions, and the chief place in his
life&mdash;all this the free-lance had foregone, to snatch
the miserable gains of adventure.</p>

<p>The announcement that lunch was on the table did
not interrupt the conversation. But it added another
interlocutor in the person of the Duke of Trent.</p>

<p>The new Minister had passed a busy morning at
the Home Office. His first care had been to send
for his solicitor, to consult him about Lord Alistair&#8217;s
affairs. The lawyer told him that, though the nominal
amount of his brother&#8217;s indebtedness was not less
than fifty thousand pounds, the creditors would probably
be willing to accept one-half to cancel the proceedings.
Twenty-five thousand was a large sum to
a man circumstanced as the Duke was; nevertheless,
he had made up his mind that it should be forthcoming,
and he had instructed the solicitor to open the
negotiations on his behalf.</p>

<p>The most important item of official business had
been a call from the Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan
Police, who reported a fresh piece of hooligan
violence from the neighbourhood of Bermondsey.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
A policeman was again the victim, and the
Force were beginning to show a dangerous temper,
and to demand permission to carry revolvers for their
own protection.</p>

<p>The Home Secretary privately sympathized with
this demand, but he foresaw that such a departure
would be the signal for a storm of protest in the
workmen&#8217;s papers and in the House of Commons.
The particular quarter of London where the latest
outrage had occurred was represented in the House
by a sturdy demagogue who was not likely to sit with
his mouth closed while his constituents were threatened
with what he had already described in advance
as martial law. The very gangs which were now defying
the police were believed to have done effective
work during the last election, and on one memorable
occasion their popular representative had led them
to an armed encounter with the forces of law and
order in the heart of the capital.</p>

<p>These considerations had to be weighed by the
Home Secretary. A Cabinet Minister in these days
holds the position of a buffer between the permanent
heads of his department, who really govern the Raj,
and the assembly elected by the populace to supervise
them. The first duty of the Minister, no doubt, was
to support his staff, but it was also imperative to take
no step that might endanger the popularity of his
party in the constituencies. In this dilemma the Duke
of Trent had reserved his decision till he should have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
had an opportunity of consulting Major Berwick, the
trusted chief of the electoral machine.</p>

<p>A smile of pleasure betrayed his gratification at the
entrance of Miss Vanbrugh, who greeted him with
the ease of old friendship. He told his mother briefly
of the steps he had already taken on Alistair&#8217;s behalf.</p>

<p>The Duchess gave him a grateful look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, dear; I knew you would do what
you could. I was just talking to Hero about the poor
boy. The one thing we have to try for now is to
make this trouble a means of rescuing him from his
present life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to make that condition, of course,&#8221; the
elder brother observed doubtingly; &#8220;but from what
you told me last night he would only refuse it if I
were to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very difficult,&#8221; the Duchess admitted. &#8220;I
am afraid you are right. Perhaps if you say nothing
about conditions, and simply let him know that
you are helping him generously, he will feel ashamed
not to make a return.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke of Trent had his own opinion as to his
brother&#8217;s sense of shame, but he did not care to express
it before Miss Vanbrugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I want most,&#8221; the Duchess proceeded, &#8220;is
to induce him to come here again. I dread the consequence
of his always being with that woman. If I
could get hold of him sometimes, and bring him into
contact with women of a different kind, I feel sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
that the contrast between them and the woman he is
living with would soon disgust him with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even if the Duchess had not stolen a glance at
Hero Vanbrugh as she spoke, her drift could hardly
have been misunderstood by the girl. The Duke
failed to see the personal application of his mother&#8217;s
remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you could find some decent woman who would
overlook the past, and get him to marry her, she
might be able to keep him straight,&#8221; he said bluntly.
&#8220;On the other hand, she might not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel sure that he might be saved by the right
woman,&#8221; the Duchess said earnestly. &#8220;I am convinced
that the poor boy is secretly sick of the life
he has been leading, and only his pride keeps him
from giving it up. A noble, pure-minded girl, who
really cared for him, would be able to do anything
she liked with Alistair.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time the allusion was too plain to be mistaken.
The Home Secretary intercepted the blush on Hero&#8217;s
face, and his eyes were opened. A look of dissatisfaction
replaced his indifferent air, as he replied with
some bitterness:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not so sure of it. Many a good woman has
sacrificed her life before now in the effort to reclaim
a man who was unworthy of her, and the sacrifice
has been in vain.&#8221;</p>

<p>In saying this he was thinking of the history of his
own father and mother, of which he had learned more
than his mother suspected. He had sometimes felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
surprised, as well as mortified, that he should have
had such a parent as Lord Alexander. Never having
seen his father since early childhood, and being free
from any tendency to romantic idealism, the Duke
was able to judge the dead man quite impartially, and
to think of him as if he had been some remote ancestor,
whose virtues and vices were merely matter
of curiosity for his descendants.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder my mother&#8217;s own experience has not
taught her the folly of thinking that a worthless man
can be redeemed by a good wife,&#8221; he reflected impatiently.
&#8220;Alistair takes after his father; no doubt
that is why she has always loved him better than me.
Her whole soul is absorbed in trying to save him
from the consequences of his own follies, and I am
merely a pawn in the game. Now she wants to enlist
Hero Vanbrugh in the same task, as if a girl like that
were fit for nothing better than to be the keeper of a
drunken prodigal.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess observed the frown on her eldest
son&#8217;s brow with wondering dismay. It did not occur
to her that he could be moved by any other feeling
than fraternal jealousy. Old-fashioned in her ideas
on this subject, as on most others, she had never contemplated
it as possible that the Duke of Trent and
Colonsay could marry out of his own class. And the
class in which, with perfectly unconscious pride, she
placed her young friend was that middle one which
appeared to have been created to supply doctors and
lawyers and men of business for the service of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
aristocracy. In her eyes the girl&#8217;s father, Sir Bernard
Vanbrugh, was simply a successful medical man.
The scientific achievements which had made him a
European personage, greater than any Secretary of
State, were outside her ken.</p>

<p>If she had come to entertain the project of marrying
Hero Vanbrugh to her prodigal son as a last
means of averting the terrible catastrophe of Molly
Finucane, she did so honestly, considering that she
offered a privilege to Hero, corresponding with the
greatness of the interest at stake. It was in the perfect
simplicity of this conviction that she had so candidly
revealed her design. In the same spirit she
had been ready to take Alistair&#8217;s brother into her
confidence without any apprehension that she might
be applying the spur of rivalry to a slumbering
admiration.</p>

<p>She was familiar with the Duke&#8217;s expressed views
on matrimony, which she respected, although they
struck a little cold on her own more emotional nature.
She knew that he had made up his mind from
an early age to two things&mdash;that he was one of the
best matches in Great Britain, and that marriage was
the most important card he had to play in the game
of life. It had long been understood between them
that Trent was in no hurry; that what he required
in a wife was a great fortune, accompanied by those
social graces which count for so much in politics; and
that when he found a possessor of both these gifts
who pleased him she would become his Duchess. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
mother lived in the mild expectation of hearing some
day that her young sultan had thrown the handkerchief
to a fitting aspirant, whom it would be her part
to welcome with what tenderness was permitted, and
in whose favour she would cheerfully resign her place
in Colonsay House.</p>

<p>Thus it lay altogether outside her calculations that
her eldest son could take any interest in Hero Vanbrugh
warmer than a passing friendship. The prudent
young statesman was the last person in the world
whom anyone acquainted with him would have believed
capable of a romantic passion. And the last
person in the world to believe it would have been the
young Minister himself.</p>

<p>A man who has lived to the age of thirty without
ever losing his head in the company of a woman naturally
regards himself as love-proof, and perhaps insensibly
relaxes his self-defence. But Hero Vanbrugh
enjoyed one great advantage over almost every unmarried
girl whom Trent had ever met, inasmuch as
she had not come before him as a candidate for the
orange-blossoms.</p>

<p>If he had met her in one of those crowded ballrooms
where her sisters are paraded nightly in the
London season for the allurement of intending purchasers,
Trent would have carefully guarded himself
from giving her a second thought. He had met her
for the first time at his own table, lunching in outdoor
costume with his mother, who introduced her
as a helper in her charitable work. The Duke, presuming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
that Miss Vanbrugh came from some humble
clerical circle, unbent from his ordinary reserve in the
desire to put her at her ease. He was rewarded for
this kindly effort by the discovery that she was beautiful
and charming.</p>

<p>It was not until afterwards that he learned from his
mother, who rallied him playfully on his fascination,
that he had been entertaining the daughter of the
great Vanbrugh. It was chance, therefore&mdash;one of
those chances that every now and then take over the
control of our lives and change them for us&mdash;that
had caused Trent to meet Hero Vanbrugh on this
easy footing instead of in the cankered atmosphere
of fashion. But the ice, once broken, could not be
re-formed, and the relations between Hero and her
host at Colonsay House had developed into intimacy.</p>

<p>Up to this time the Duke&#8217;s mental attitude had
been that of a man who views a tempting object in
a shop-window, and stands hesitating, purse in hand,
wishful to buy, but unable to make up his mind to
give the price. Now he suddenly became aware that
another possible purchaser was coming up, and that
if he wanted to make sure of the bargain, he must
lose no more time.</p>

<p>An embarrassing silence was broken by Hero, who
undertook to divert the thoughts of the Home Secretary
by asking:</p>

<p>&#8220;What do they think in the Home Office of the
Legitimist Guild?&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>THE DECADENTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was some time after dinner when the Duke of
Trent, faithful to his promise to their mother, drove
up to the gate of Alistair&#8217;s house in Chelsea.</p>

<p>On the way James considered what line it would
be best for him to take. He reckoned on finding the
prodigal in a despondent mood, perhaps half estranged
from the temptress already, under the stress
of poverty and disgrace. If so, it should prove an
easy task to appeal to him by the picture of the welcome
awaiting him in Colonsay House. Alistair could
not but be touched by his brother&#8217;s generosity&mdash;and
James meant to be generous. He meant to say&mdash;to
say a little condescendingly, perhaps, but kindly: &#8220;I
take your debts on myself. Your name is cleared.
Your mother and I only ask you not to forget that
you have a home to come to when you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>By the time he had reached the house the Duke
had half persuaded himself that he should be able
to bring the repentant one away with him that very
night.</p>

<p>The house was surrounded on all sides by a high
brick wall, pierced at the entrance by a tall narrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
gateway, the gate of Georgian ironwork. Ordering
his coachman to wait, the Minister strode up a covered
pathway that led to the door of the house, and
knocked.</p>

<p>As he did so he was aware that the lower part of
the house was brilliantly lit up. He caught a murmur
of voices coming through the windows of a room
which overlooked the front garden, and even heard
what sounded like applause.</p>

<p>Before he could frame any explanation to himself
of these sights and sounds the door was opened by
a smart lad in a rather untidy page&#8217;s livery, who
stared at the visitor with the vulgar impertinence of
a servant who does not respect his employers.</p>

<p>At the same instant a loud burst of laughter came
from the interior of the building.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Lord Alistair at home?&#8221; the Duke demanded
sharply, incensed by this reception.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s engaged,&#8221; said the boy glibly, giving the
Duke a cautious look. &#8220;What name, please?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duke of Trent. I am his lordship&#8217;s brother,&#8221;
returned the Home Secretary, frowning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right, my lord&mdash;I mean Your
Grace,&#8221; the page responded, with an air of relief.
&#8220;Come in, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, scarcely giving the visitor time to remove his
hat, he threw open the door of the room from whence
the sounds had proceeded, and announced him.</p>

<p>The new-comer took two steps through the doorway,
and stopped astounded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>He had arrived on the scene of a festivity. Around
a dining-table, crowded with a confusion of dessert-dishes,
champagne-bottles, coffee-cups, cigar-boxes,
and spirit-stands, with the ashes of innumerable cigars
and cigarettes soaking in the spilt wine and coffee on
the tablecloth, were seated some seven or eight men,
most of them young, all wearing evening dress, and
seeming to be in the highest spirits. At the head of
the table, facing the Duke as he came in, the woman
he had come to snatch his brother away from lolled
back in her chair, puffing a cigarette, her hands monstrously
encumbered with coloured stones, and her
powdered bosom resplendent with five or six chains
of jewellery. At the foot of the table, beside the door
by which James had just entered, the brother he had
come to pardon and to redeem turned languidly in
his seat, and, rising with studied nonchalance, removed
a cigar from his lips to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;That you, Trent? So good of you to join us.&#8221;
And, turning to the company again, he added the
careless introduction: &#8220;My brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>His second glance round the room had warned the
angry Duke that, however he might be disposed to
treat Molly Finucane, her guests were not men whom
he had any right to object to meet. Too well-bred
to make a scene under the circumstances, he choked
down his indignation, and, after a haughty bow,
which neither included nor excluded the lady of the
house, he accepted the chair which someone offered
him. It was with a sense of satisfaction not unmingled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
with surprise that the Secretary of State discovered
on sitting down that his neighbour was a personal
acquaintance, the great Mendes, head of the
South American Bank, and a financier with whom
Cabinet Ministers were obliged to reckon.</p>

<p>Lord Alistair vouchsafed a light word of explanation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Been having a little feed to celebrate my smash,&#8221;
he said, waving his hand over the dirty table. &#8220;These
are my friends. You see before you the members of
the Dishonourable Brotherhood of Decadents, an association
for the spread of corruption among the upper
classes. Dishonourable Brother St. John, I call
upon you for a speech.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth is all this?&#8221; the Duke demanded
in a whisper of his neighbour.</p>

<p>The millionaire shrugged his shoulders, as though
he were slightly ashamed of his company.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose they intend it for humour,&#8221; he answered
in the same key. &#8220;It&#8217;s one of your brother&#8217;s ideas.
He&#8217;s always starting something of the kind. It used
to be a Chinese Guild, and they all dressed as mandarins
and wore pigtails. Last year it was an anti-Semite
show, and Stuart had the cheek to ask me to
join it.&#8221; The Jew&#8217;s smile as he said this was a trifle
threatening. &#8220;They parody everything. That
Frenchman opposite, Des Louvres&#8221;&mdash;he nodded towards
a man with a thin, wicked-looking face and
small dark beard and moustache&mdash;&#8220;he is at the bottom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
of it, I believe. They may know something
about him in your Office.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Home Secretary was staggered. Possessed
of too little imagination to see anything in the proceedings
but a rather scandalous jest of the kind that
undergraduates indulge in at places like Cambridge
and Oxford, he felt that the mere fact of the jest
being carried out by grown men made it doubly unbecoming.
And he felt personally aggrieved that
these men should be making merry over an event
which had cast a shadow on the house of which he
was the head. He recalled his mother&#8217;s grief, Prince
Herbert&#8217;s gracious interest, the money sacrifice which
he himself was preparing to make; and his heart
swelled with inward wrath and shame.</p>

<p>He could not help wondering privately what Mendes
was doing in such company. The keen, remorseless
man of business who had executed a masterpiece
of legal robbery, and thereby made himself one of
the new world powers which were taking the place
of Kings and Cabinets, seemed strangely out of place
among that crew of mockers. The Brazilian sat for
the most part silent, his lips set in an ironical smile.
But from time to time his glance wandered in the
direction of Molly Finucane, who moved restively in,
her chair whenever she caught Mendes&#8217;s black eyes
fixed on hers.</p>

<p>The rest of the revellers were all excited in different
degrees by the wine they had been drinking, and
their remarks and interruptions formed a sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
ground-bass to the speech which Alistair had called
for. Mr. Gerald St. John, whom the &#8220;Court Guide,&#8221;
more tender of his dignity than he seemed to be himself,
described as &#8220;Honourable,&#8221; was a man of about
the same age as Stuart, though his bald forehead gave
him the appearance of being older. He had some
little reputation as an amateur in music and painting;
he had composed songs which were occasionally sung,
and painted pictures which the New Gallery did not
disdain.</p>

<p>Addressing his friends as &#8220;Dishonourable Brethren,&#8221;
he hailed them as the missionaries of a new
gospel. Theirs was the task to purge society of Puritanism
and propriety. They were to set the example
of becoming artists in Beautiful Sin. It was impossible
for Trent to tell how far he was serious. His
speech mingled echoes of the cant of a certain class
of literary and artistic critics with what appeared to
be broad farce.</p>

<p>But two passages in the address made an impression
on the Minister, by their curious connection with
his recent interests. The first was a surprising compliment
to the Church of Rome; the second was a
panegyric in a much broader vein of the hooligans.</p>

<p>Of the Roman Church the speaker said that it was
the only form of Christianity which deserved their
toleration and respect. He regarded it as the true
Church of the Decadence, and as such he called upon
the Brotherhood to support it. He was not himself
a Catholic; he was a polytheist. But he considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
that, next to polytheism, the Church of Rome afforded
the best rallying-point for all that was beautiful
and corrupt in the art and life of the age.</p>

<p>This extraordinary eulogy was received with vociferous
applause, especially by the French Count, whose
air was that of a man enjoying a personal triumph.
Molly Finucane, who had not been to Mass or Confession
for many years, but who had not quite shaken
off her early impressions, tried to disguise her nervousness
by hammering the table with her wineglass
till it broke&mdash;an accident which she was half disposed
to interpret as the work of an offended Power.</p>

<p>The Duke of Trent, who entertained a vague respect
for the Roman Church as a venerable institution
whose influence was generally exerted on the side
of the Conservative party, hardly knew what to think
of this equivocal homage to its merits. The Honourable
Gerald St. John passed on to the question of
hooliganism, not without a shy glance in the direction
of the Home Secretary, which showed how much
the jest was enhanced by the presence of hooliganism&#8217;s
official adversary.</p>

<p>The hooligans, he declared, were crusaders fighting
for the same cause as that Dishonourable Brotherhood.
They were martyrs of the new individualism.
Their so-called outrages constituted a protest&mdash;the
only form of protest which dull and hidebound statesmen
could understand&mdash;against the iron yoke of Socialist
civilization, under which they were all groaning.
He regarded the hooligans as saviours. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
significant that so far the man whom they had selected
for attack was that embodiment of everything
vulgar and virtuous, the suburban ratepayer. When
they had exterminated the ratepayer, he hoped they
would go on to the millionaire. He had always regretted
that their fellow-workers, the Anarchists,
should show so much antipathy to Kings. It was an
unreasonable prejudice. Kings were picturesque survivals
in the midst of the hideous monotony of modern
life. Kings were rarely respectable, and were not
seldom steeped in crime; and this applied particularly
to those romantic claimants&mdash;he, the speaker, preferred
the dear old name &#8220;Pretender&#8221;&mdash;whom their
Dishonourable Brother on the left was seeking to
restore.</p>

<p>This allusion was accepted by Des Louvres with
eager manifestations of approval. Once more the
Secretary of State felt an obscure uneasiness as he
compared these mocking utterances with the recent experience
of his own department, and he began to
ask himself if he was indeed listening to the first whispers
of a coming storm.</p>

<p>Hero Vanbrugh&#8217;s question about the Legitimist
Guild had not fallen on deaf ears. He had had the
curiosity to ask his permanent staff if they knew anything
of the Legitimists, and he found they knew very
little. There is nothing Government Departments
dislike so much as information, except the trouble of
acting on it. No one in the Home Office could say
exactly who the Legitimists were, or how they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
come into existence as a guild. Their very number
was unknown, but it was believed to be insignificant.
They were wholly without influence or following, and
would never have been heard of but for the fact that
the newspapers regarded their proceedings as a good
joke. Every sensible person put them down as a
clique of vain and foolish young men who made themselves
supremely ridiculous by trying to revive a cause
which had been dead for a hundred and fifty years.</p>

<p>Such was the official view. Sixty or seventy years
before a similar view had been taken of the action
of a little clique of Oxford men who were setting
themselves to undo the work of the Protestant Reformation.
That little clique had undertaken to break
up a settlement which had taken root for two hundred
and fifty years, and had survived twelve reigns
and six rebellions. In the course of a single reign
they had come within sight of their goal. They had
driven the word &#8220;Protestant&#8221; out of polite conversation,
and made it a synonym for everything base, ignorant
and malicious. They had made it dangerous
for a Protestant to object publicly to Catholic practices
which were still forbidden by the letter of the
law. They had sent an informal embassy to the Vatican
to negotiate the re-entry of England into the Roman
obedience; and they had delivered the first open
attack on the legislative bars which still hindered that
consummation.</p>

<p>Fresh from the assurances of the Home Office, it
was a shock to the Minister to find himself for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
second time that day confronted with this ridiculous
but offensive movement. It was true that Mr. St.
John&#8217;s remarks bordered on satire, but the serious-minded
are apt to resent satire at the expense of what
they fear, as much as at the expense of what they
revere; the only notes they wish to hear are the snap
of cavil and the rumble of denunciation.</p>

<p>If the Duke of Trent had consulted his own inclination
he would have risen and protested against this
trifling with treason. But, like most men who are
deprived of the sense of humour, James Stuart was
keenly sensitive to ridicule, and he dared not expose
himself to the merciless wit of this crew of profligates.
He bitterly repented the false step he had taken in
sitting down amongst them, but he sought in vain for
any means of extrication.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the orator concluded with a felicitous
reference to the occasion of the feast.</p>

<p>One Dishonourable Brother&mdash;in fact, the founder
of their Order, he said&mdash;had shown that it was
possible to emulate, if not to surpass, the exploits of
the humble hooligan. By his magnificent defiance of
the day before he had struck dismay into the mercenary
ranks of their hereditary foes&mdash;he need not say
he meant the trading class, whose shameful supremacy
had made England unfit to live in. Their gallant
host had plundered the hostile camp of a sum which
represented one of the greatest triumphs ever
achieved over the Philistine. He called upon him, in
their name, not to pay this <i>canaille</i> a farthing in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
pound. And he called upon them to drink confusion
to the respectable classes, coupled with the name of
their Arch Decadent!</p>

<p>Everyone rose to his feet to drink the toast, with
the exception of the bankrupt himself, and his brother,
who tried to conceal his disgust under an air of
amused tolerance.</p>

<p>Alistair Stuart was conscious of his brother&#8217;s real
feeling, and resented it all the more because he was
half ashamed of his own part in the buffoonery. His
tone became louder and more insolent as he gulped
down glass after glass of spirits, and called upon one
or other of his guests to keep up the entertainment.</p>

<p>Nobody dared call upon the Secretary of State.
They all knew enough to feel that he was a stranger
in the camp, if not a spy, and only the emphasized
indifference of Stuart to his brother&#8217;s presence gave
them courage to go on. The presence of this representative
of all that they professed to loathe and despise,
looking on with chill disapproval, dashed their
spirits unexpectedly, and even to their own ears their
customary jests took on a hollow sound.</p>

<p>Presently it came to the turn of a youth seated
opposite to the Duke. He was of a pale and sickly
countenance, the whiteness of his face being accentuated
by the black locks which he allowed to grow
down to his neck. His tie was a black sash with
flowing ends like that worn by French Art students
in the quarter of Batignolles. He did not appear to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
be much more than twenty, and answered to the name
of Egerton Vane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221; Trent asked his neighbour.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lunatic with the scarf round his neck? That&#8217;s
a minor poet. I don&#8217;t suppose you have ever come
across his works. He publishes two volumes every
year, at his own expense, of course, with about twenty
poems in each. No one ever reads them, except the
provincial reviewers. He has got an album filled
with cuttings from papers like the <i>Pembrokeshire
News</i> and the <i>Berwick-on-Tweed Gazette</i>. &#8216;A volume
of verse from the graceful pen of Mr. Egerton
Vane&#8217;&mdash;that&#8217;s the kind of incense he feeds on. Once
he got a puff in a paper called the <i>Librarian</i>, and carried
it about with him for months. He said to me
with tears in his eyes: &#8216;This is recognition!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Everyone in the room seemed to have some literary
or artistic vocation, except Mendes himself. The
motive which brought the South American there remained
unguessed by Trent, but it was clear that he
extracted some amusement from his strange associates.</p>

<p>&#8220;That other young fool over there is his brother,
Wickham Vane,&#8221; the millionaire continued, indicating
a boy of eighteen or thereabouts, at the other
end of the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he write poetry, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he doesn&#8217;t do anything so material as write.
He thinks beautifully about old tapestry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wickham Vane might have been pursuing his peculiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
vocation at that moment from his absorbed
expression. But he roused himself from his abstraction
to pay the homage of attention to his elder
brother.</p>

<p>Egerton Vane held a large sheet of paper in his
hand, but before reading from it he prepared his hearers&#8217;
minds by a short allocution.</p>

<p>&#8220;The poem I am about to read you strikes an entirely
new note in literature, the note of the unreal.
It is a &#8216;Sonnet to a Drawer in a Japanese Cabinet.&#8217; I
have come to the conclusion that all the poets who
have preceded me have been mistaken in thinking
that Nature was poetical. The artificial only is poetical,
because only Art can be artistic. Nature is incapable
of symbolism, and the symbol alone is truly
beautiful. All the glorious sins which reveal themselves
crudely and grossly in mere human beings are
latent in exquisite suggestion in the divinely precious
works of Art. Even the handicrafts of the East are
steeped in the splendid sensuality of its peoples. In
this poem I have attempted to do justice to the subtle
and elusive vice which clings like the aroma of putrefying
rose-leaves to the workmanship of a Japanese
cabinet in my possession.&#8221;</p>

<p>The poet proceeded to read:</p>


<p class="center">SONNET</p>

<p class="center">TO A DRAWER IN A JAPANESE CABINET</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">What shadow of dead secrets, lemon-eyed,</div>
<div class="indent">Lurks in thy black recesses, frightful drawer,</div>
<div class="indent">Crowned with the Pagan scent of delicate gore</div>
<div class="verse">Fresh from the veins of some green suicide?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>


<div class="verse">Behold thy lacquered sins are glorified</div>
<div class="indent">In frantic fowls that round thy handle soar,</div>
<div class="indent">Mad with obscure desires, like those that tore</div>
<div class="verse">Unclean blue M&aelig;nads by the Phrygian tide!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And horrors like vermilion rats awake</div>
<div class="indent">And crawl about thee, crooning in my ears</div>
<div class="verse">Dim, vampire songs of shrivelled souls that ache</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">With the strange lust for torture-baths of pain;</div>
<div class="verse">Sick with the thirst of poison drunk in vain,</div>
<div class="indent">And bleeding with the clammy blood of tears.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The new note thus successfully struck in literature
was applauded with a vehemence that concealed some
jealousy on the part of the other poets present. Only
Molly Finucane, who was beginning to feel herself
left out in the cold, asked the author impertinently
what his work meant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing!&#8221; was the rapt reply. &#8220;All Art is quite
meaningless.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke of Trent turned to Mendes.</p>

<p>&#8220;And is that absurd and disgusting rubbish the sort
of thing which passes for poetry to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to-day, perhaps, but it will pass for it to-morrow.
If Egerton Vane goes on long enough, I
have no doubt he will found a school. But I have
noticed that most young fellows who begin like that
end by going into a monastery.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke began to see a new usefulness in the institutions
which he had been brought up to regard
with aversion.</p>

<p>The Brazilian, who knew the weak spot in most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
of his fellow-men, maliciously threw an apple of discord
among the company by asking Egerton Vane
across the table what he thought of the poems of
Rowley Drummer.</p>

<p>The quarrel which instantly arose and raged over
the merits of this distinguished writer showed that
envy of a rival&#8217;s renown may be a stronger passion
than hatred of the middle classes.</p>

<p>The chief apologist for the poet was a man who
had recently achieved a scandalous success with a
novel in which he dealt faithfully with the vices of
all his most intimate friends. The terror inspired
by this performance had made him for the moment
the most courted man in London society, and persons
like the brothers Vane followed him about everywhere
in the hope of finding themselves pilloried to
fame in Basil Dyke&#8217;s next libel.</p>

<p>Dyke, who found his antipathy to the <i>bourgeoisie</i>
sensibly diminished by every cheque which reached
him from his publisher, and who was already meditating
desertion from the decadent ranks in favour
of marriage with an heiress, put forward a claim
on behalf of his client which it did not seem easy to
refute.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has made vice popular in the person of the
British soldier,&#8221; he urged. &#8220;He has stamped with
brazen hoofs upon the Gordons and the Havelocks
and the prayer-meeting heroes of the Victorian Age,
and has called upon the drudging taxpayer to bow
down and worship a swearing, drinking blackguard.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
His patriotism is nauseous in itself, I grant, but then
he has made it patriotic to break the Ten Commandments.
He has identified Imperialism with
immorality.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And therefore, I suppose, you would say with
Art?&#8221; retorted Egerton Vane, with ill-concealed annoyance.
&#8220;All Art is immoral, but it does not follow
that all immorality is artistic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Vulgarity is never artistic,&#8221; added the thinker
about old tapestry, coming to his brother&#8217;s support.
&#8220;Rowley Drummer has no sense of the unreal. He
sees life in all its blinding vulgarity, and therefore
the better he paints it, the worse is the result.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dyke saw that he had gone too far. It is always
bad manners to praise one poet in the hearing of another.
He tried to qualify his praise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not defend him as an artist,&#8221; he explained,
&#8220;but as a demagogue. I say that the coarse passion
called patriotism, in his hands, has been turned to
a good purpose. After he has taught the public to
acclaim the hooligans of the barrack-room, they cannot
very well flog the hooligans of the street.&#8221;</p>

<p>To the Minister, fresh from his legislative essay,
this remark sounded like a challenge. Once more a
doubt invaded his mind as to whether all that he was
listening to was sheer ribaldry, or whether there were
not underlying it some serious purpose, or at least
some serious tendency, of which Cabinet Ministers
one day might have to take heed.</p>

<p>Molly Finucane had been feeling bored for some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
time, and, what was worse, feeling that her exclusion
from the conversation reflected on her position
as the lady of the house. She seized this opportunity
to assert her prerogative.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who talks of flogging the hooligans?&#8221; she asked,
with a good deal of scorn. &#8220;They&#8217;ll have to catch
&#8217;em first.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped short, warned by the uneasy looks of
the rest that she had committed herself in some way.
Molly did not read the papers, and so was ignorant
of the recent proceedings of the House of Lords. But
she was aware that Lord Alistair&#8217;s brother was identified
in some way with the Government, and therefore
with the cause of law and order, and she guessed
that her expressions might contain some element of
offence.</p>

<p>There had been a time when Molly would have
enjoyed nothing so much as shocking a Cabinet Minister
by telling him across her own table that her
brother was a corner-boy. But for the past year a
great change had come over her disposition, as great
as that which transforms the roystering medical student
into the serious family practitioner. It had not
needed the letter from Lord Alistair&#8217;s mother to put
before her the idea of becoming Lord Alistair&#8217;s wife,
nor to teach her the way in which his friends would
take such an alliance. To become Lady Alistair without
at the same time obtaining the social honours
which other Lady Alistairs enjoyed would do little
to satisfy that yearning for other women&#8217;s respect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
which is the torment appointed for such as Molly
Finucane. And there was enough good in Molly to
make her anxious for Alistair&#8217;s sake not to be a permanent
blight on his career. It was for his sake as
much as for her own that she had been striving painfully
for the last twelve months to acquire the habitudes
of a lady.</p>

<p>The unexpected arrival of the Duke of Trent had
caused her a thrill of pleasurable excitement. To
make a good impression on the head of the family,
she felt, would bring her half-way to the goal. Now,
at the thought that she had been so near to disgracing
herself, she could have bitten her tongue.</p>

<p>Molly&#8217;s preoccupations were not shared by Alistair,
who took it for granted that his brother had come
to reproach him, and resented what seemed to him
an impertinent intrusion. By this time he had drunk
too much to care what he said or did, and the desire
was strong upon him to wreak his bitter feelings on
the head of his favoured elder.</p>

<p>Staggering to his feet, and casting a disdainful look
at the silent and annoyed Duke, he burst out:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a hooligan. I&#8217;ve been trying to disguise it
ever since I was a boy, but I&#8217;m not going to try any
more. I hate your law and order; I hate your respectability;
I hate your civilization. Our forefathers
were thieves and murderers, and I envy them.
They lived a jolly life among the heather and the
hills, and they were gentlemen. They didn&#8217;t cringe
to cobblers and butchers for votes, and go to church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
on Sundays to please their grocer. They swore and
drank and diced as much as they liked, and never
asked what the Dissenters thought of them. I am
sick of the strait-waistcoat; I am sick of swallow-tail
coats and prayer-books. Why should I torture myself
in the effort to lead your unnatural life? I protest
against it all. Life is one long persecution of men
like me, by men like you. Why can&#8217;t you leave me
alone, as I leave you alone? I don&#8217;t force you to drink
and gamble, and lead what you are pleased to call
an immoral life. Why do you try to force me to lead
a moral one?&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, and then, as if the overflow
of his wrath had sobered him, went on in a more
serious vein:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your ideal? Show me the man you honour,
and I will show you the value of your morality.
The hero of to-day is the successful cheat, the tradesman
who has made a million by selling rotten food
to the poor or to your own soldiers in South Africa;
the bandit of the Stock Exchange; the monopolist who
has broken the hearts and ruined the lives of a hundred
struggling rivals, and who three hundred years
ago would have been hanged as an engrosser. That
is the man to whom you kneel, for whom all the doors
of all the churches are thrown open, in whose name
I am ordered to reform my ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker seemed to feel the need of pointing
his denunciation with a personal application.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am your victim. I am the man whose life is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
ground out beneath the Juggernaut wheels of what
you call your social system. Why? Because I cannot
become hard and selfish and stupid like your
model. It is monotony that you want; it is originality
that you hate. Go to the tombs of your martyrs&mdash;most
of them are buried in Westminster Abbey or
St. Paul&#8217;s&mdash;Goldsmith the bankrupt, Nelson the adulterer,
Pitt the drunkard, Shakespeare the debauchee.
Those are the men whom you are trying to exterminate,
and you have nearly succeeded. I&mdash;I had something
here, perhaps&#8221;&mdash;he smote his forehead with
his hand&mdash;&#8220;and I might have done something if I
had ever had the chance. But you have killed me.
All the bright instincts, all the golden wings that fluttered
in the dawn, all the magic whispers, all the reveries
and dreams&mdash;they are dead and still and silent
now. Your work is done.&#8221;</p>

<p>A slight shiver went round the room and touched
even the Cabinet Minister, who had been more than
once on the point of rising and taking his departure.</p>

<p>Suddenly Alistair Stuart broke into a loud laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, my Dishonourable friends&mdash;thank
you for your support to-night. You see before you
a bankrupt, but a merry one. You will hear of me
again before long. I think of taking a house on the
south side of the river, and turning hooligan. I invite
you to become members of my band. I hope
to give some trouble to the authorities. We are fortunate
in having one of them here to-night. I invite
you to drink his health, gentlemen&mdash;my brother, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
Home Secretary, author of a Bill to punish the hooligans
by flogging. In your name I defy him, and
drink damnation to his Bill!&#8221;</p>

<p>The thickness of his speech and the increasing wildness
of his behaviour relieved Lord Alistair&#8217;s hearers
from the necessity of treating this as anything but
the utterance of an intoxicated man. But it was
clearly necessary to put an end to the scene.</p>

<p>Mendes and the Duke of Trent rose together, but
the financier was the first to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, it is time we were going. Stuart, sit
down! You don&#8217;t know what you are doing!&#8221;</p>

<p>He thrust Lord Alistair down into a chair and held
him there, while the others made their hasty farewells
and streamed out into the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am obliged to you, Mendes,&#8221; said the Duke.
&#8220;Do you think,&#8221; he added in a whisper, &#8220;you could
get that girl out of the way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s her house, I believe, but I&#8217;ll try to send her
to bed,&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>The Brazilian went up to Molly, who sat looking
rather frightened at her end of the table. He said a
few words in a low voice which appeared to produce
the right effect. Molly Finucane glanced timidly at
the Duke, and then came towards him with an evident
desire to propitiate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll leave him with you, if you like,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but
you won&#8217;t find it much good talking to him to-night,
I expect. You&#8217;d better come again in the morning,
if it&#8217;s any business.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>Trent confined himself to bowing silently, and Mendes
accompanied Miss Finucane out of the room,
leaving the brothers together.</p>

<p>Alistair had remained still, with his head resting
in his hands, as though exhausted by his passion.
Hearing the door close, he looked up sullenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you want with me?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Faithful to his resolve to be gracious, in spite of
the provocations he had received, the Duke made a
mild answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to come home, Alistair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My house is your home,&#8221; said James, not unkindly;
and, with a tact of which he was not always capable,
he added: &#8220;Our mother&#8217;s house is the home
of both of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair reddened.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is she?&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is very anxious and unhappy about you. I
have promised her to save you, if you will let me.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time the elder brother&#8217;s words were not so
well chosen. It always grated on Alistair to be reminded
that he was dependent on James.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t leave my friends,&#8221; he said stubbornly.</p>

<p>Trent thought of the company he had just seen
depart, and his indignation got the better of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Friends!&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Friends who have landed
you in the Bankruptcy Court!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you didn&#8217;t keep me out of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Trent made a strong effort to keep his temper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen my solicitor to-day with the object<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
of preventing the adjudication. Alistair, I will do
it, if you will only pull yourself together, and make
it possible for your mother and me to help you. I
will pay your debts once more, though I can ill afford
it, and start you again with a clean sheet, if you will
only take advantage of it. Come! I have got the
brougham waiting outside. Why shouldn&#8217;t you get
up now, and let me take you straight away with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>He tried to speak cheerfully and confidently. But
there was no encouragement in the bleared eyes that
looked up at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! and leave Molly after she&#8217;s stuck to me all
this time? D&#8217;you think I&#8217;m a cad, Trent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You called yourself a hooligan just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trent regretted the retort the moment it had passed
his lips. But it was too late. Alistair started up
angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, damn it! I&#8217;ll <i>be</i> a hooligan before I will sell
the little woman for a few miserable thousands, like
that! Go to the devil, you and your clean sheet!
I&#8217;m sorry for the old mater, if she feels it, but I
can&#8217;t stand your patronage, and I won&#8217;t have your
moralizing; so you can just leave me alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will leave you alone!&#8221; exclaimed his brother.
&#8220;God forgive me, I sometimes wonder what I have
done to deserve being cursed with such a brother as
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned and strode out of the room, leaving
Alistair to sway and sink down with his head upon
the table among the ashes and wine-stains of the extinguished
revel.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />


<small>A LEGITIMIST DEMONSTRATION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> carriage which brought the Duchess of Trent
and Miss Vanbrugh to the Legitimist bazaar set them
down at the door of a mean-looking, brick-built
schoolroom, over the door of which was a niche containing
the statue of a woman holding a babe in her
arms.</p>

<p>This woman was intended for a Jewish peasant,
wife of the carpenter Joseph of Nazareth. This babe
was her Divine Son, the second person of the Christian
Triad.</p>

<p>The woman wore an emblem of glory in the form
of a crown on her head. The babe&#8217;s head was undecorated.
The group was copied without alteration
from the ancient pagan idols of the Great Mother
and her Child, worshipped for countless ages in the
Mediterranean zone.</p>

<p>Beneath the niche four letters were cut. They
were the four initials, A.M.D.G., of the Latin words,
<i>Ad majorem Dei gloriam</i>&mdash;&#8220;To the greater glory of
God.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the motto of the famous Society of Jesus,
set up over a building in which the children of Protestant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
Churchmen were being educated. Only the Jesuit
motto was not set out in full; it was merely hinted
at by those cryptic letters. This was a touch that
Ignatius Loyola would have admired.</p>

<p>Neither of the two ladies observed the unobtrusive
initials, nor, if they had done so, would they have
understood their significance. But they could scarcely
avoid seeing the idol in its niche; and just as they
were stepping out of the carriage a bright little lad,
attractively robed in a white gown with a red vest
above, evidently a singing-boy from the church hard
by, passed through the doorway, bowing reverently
to the sacred image as he went up the steps.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Trent was amazed. Her works
of charity had never brought her into this part of
the parish, and she had always kept herself from
contact with the religious activities of St. Jermyn&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that is not Popery, I should like to know what
is?&#8221; she exclaimed bluntly to her young friend. &#8220;Did
you see that boy bowing to the Virgin Mary? I have
no doubt they are taught to pray to her as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>This surmise was perfectly just. Such slight control
as the episcopate, or at least the lay judges of
the Privy Council, exercised over the services in St.
Jermyn&#8217;s Church, appeared to cease altogether on
the threshold of the school. Within that building
Dr. Coles was supreme, and taught what religion he
pleased. If it had suited him to set up an image of
Siva for the adoration of his scholars, or to inculcate
the most degrading beliefs of primitive savagery, no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
one would have interfered with his discretion. Thus,
while the Vicar maintained some of the forms of
Anglican worship in the parish church, in the schoolroom
he had long laid them aside. The catechism
taught to the boys was one prepared by a clerical secret
society, and was carefully contrived to fill the
learner&#8217;s mind with hatred for the Protestant heresy,
and to turn it in the direction of Catholic Unity.</p>

<p>A special liturgy, compiled by the same hands, was
also provided for the use of the scholars. In it the
Mother of God figured as the principal, though not
the sole, object of worship, the Apostle Peter taking
the second place. Among the prayers, precedence
was given to one for the Patriarch of the West&mdash;&#8220;Thy
servant Leo, that he may be inspired rightly
to define and zealously to defend the faith once delivered
to Thy saints.&#8221; After this came petitions on
behalf of a personage discreetly referred to as &#8220;the
lawful Sovereign of these realms,&#8221; the souls of the
dead &#8220;now awaiting Thy judgment,&#8221; and the reunion,
&#8220;under one visible Head on earth,&#8221; of all branches
of the Holy Catholic Church. Dr. Coles himself
was responsible for a supplementary prayer in which
&#8220;our blessed patron, Saint Jermyn,&#8221; was complimented
on his influence with the Mother of God, due to
the continence of his life on earth, and implored to
use that influence on behalf of the area for which he
was, as it were, the spiritual County Councillor.</p>

<p>It was a document breathing the spirit of the Dark
Ages, when God figured in men&#8217;s minds as a sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
Byzantine Emperor, surrounded by a court of heavenly
chamberlains and eunuchs, each dispensing favours
to his own train of followers, and none incapable
of being bribed.</p>

<p>Miss Vanbrugh, regarding the symbolical sculpture
with the indifference born of ignorance, smiled
at her friend&#8217;s indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us go in,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s so bad
inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>The whitewashed walls of the room in which they
found themselves offered a curious medley of science
and religion, evidencing a painful struggle in the mind
of Dr. Coles between proselytizing zeal and a desire
to earn the grants of an heretical Government. A
large crucifix over the teacher&#8217;s desk was flanked by
a geological map of Great Britain, and a glass case
containing silk in various stages from the cocoon to
the finished skein. The Ten Commandments on one
wall were faced by the two hemispheres on the other;
and an illuminated calendar of Holy Days was half
concealed by a chart depicting screws, wedges, levers,
and other mechanical appliances. The cloven, or at
least the clerical, hoof peeped out in a series of cartoons
illustrative of English history, the scenes chosen
being all in one category&mdash;the landing of Augustine,
the martyrdom of Edmund, Thomas &agrave; Becket defying
Henry II., and Langton, with a formidable crozier,
extorting Magna Charta from King John apparently
by the threat of physical violence, while the barons
respectfully looked on.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>On this particular occasion the eye was quickly distracted
from these mural decorations by the exhibition
beneath. The room, which was large enough
to contain one or two hundred people, was lined round
three sides by stalls loaded with that extraordinary
description of articles which are manufactured specially
for sale at bazaars, and in which the greatest
possible uselessness is combined with the greatest possible
fragility. Children&#8217;s frocks, which no child
could wear for an hour without damaging them, embroidered
tobacco-pouches sufficient to dismay the
most stout-hearted smoker, weird contrivances of paper
and cheap ribbon described as toilet-tidies, ridiculous
pin-cushions, and impossible patchwork quilts
formed the staple of the display. In one corner a
lottery was being conducted by the Rev. Aloysius
Grimes, happy in that immunity from the law which
newspaper editors cannot obtain; and pretty little
choristers, in their sacred vestments, were passing to
and fro among the ladies doing a roaring trade in
the sale of tickets. But the great attraction of the
afternoon was the theatre, which had been organized
in an adjoining classroom, and in which it was announced
that a Miracle Play would be produced at
four o&#8217;clock, under the direction of Egerton Vane,
Esq.</p>

<p>As soon as Mr. Grimes caught sight of the Duchess
of Trent and her companion, he handed over the
care of the lottery to a young lady assistant, and hastened
forward to greet them. He was just shaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
hands, when a stir in the doorway announced the arrival
of Dr. Coles.</p>

<p>In appearance the Vicar of St. Jermyn&#8217;s contrasted
very favourably with his curate. It was easy to see
that he was a man of education and refinement, and
his white hairs gave him a certain dignity. His face
was that of a sensualist, but the benevolent smile,
which had become almost stereotyped on his lips, produced
an impression of cordiality and goodness of
heart. The Doctor&#8217;s career had not been quite untroubled
by the voice of scandal. But any bygone
slips on the part of a saintly man had been forgotten
or forgiven. The reverent murmur which welcomed
his appearance among his flock was a striking testimony
to the influence he had secured over those
among whom he worked.</p>

<p>The Rev. Aloysius, breaking away from the two
ladies in the middle of a sentence, without apology,
was the first to cast himself on both knees before his
employer, and respectfully kiss a large ring on the
Vicar&#8217;s extended forefinger.</p>

<p>&#8220;What in the name of goodness does that mean?&#8221;
the astonished Duchess asked of Hero.</p>

<p>She spoke loudly enough to be heard by several
persons in the throng, who turned and cast rebuking
glances at her. Directly afterwards she saw a number
of well-dressed women advance one after the other
and salute the Vicar of St. Jermyn&#8217;s with the same
ceremonial as that observed by Mr. Grimes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they all mad, or what is it?&#8221; the Duchess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
whispered. &#8220;I have never seen such a thing before
in my life, except when I was abroad, in Roman Catholic
society. But even they don&#8217;t kneel to their priests,
only to a Bishop.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hero blushed guiltily. She was better informed
than the Duchess, but she was not sure that her knowledge
might not damage her in her friend&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps these people regard Dr. Coles as a
Bishop,&#8221; she suggested timidly. &#8220;Have you never
heard it whispered that he had been secretly
consecrated by&mdash;an Armenian Bishop, I think?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess stared at her in honest bewilderment.</p>

<p>&#8220;How could that be? I don&#8217;t understand. Why
should an English clergyman go to Armenia to be
consecrated?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hero saw that she must make her revelation
complete.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand the object was to renew the Apostolical
Succession in the Church of England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has never been broken,&#8221; said the Duchess, with
decision. She had been told so as a girl, and had
never given the subject a second thought. To her
devout mind, too candid to be taken in logical snares,
the presence or absence of one or two or three Bishops
at the consecration of another could not seem a
matter of real concern. To attribute to such details
the awful consequences they possess for Catholic
minds would have seemed to her to attribute the technical
instincts of a small attorney to the Maker of the
sun and stars.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>&#8220;The Pope of Rome refuses to recognize Anglican
Orders, you know,&#8221; Hero explained gently. &#8220;The
application was made to him the other day by Lord
Bargreave on behalf of a third of the clergy, and he
told them that the English Church had no Bishops,
no priests, and no Sacraments.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess flushed to the roots of her hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I was a girl,&#8221; she said sternly, &#8220;the Church
of England would have refused to recognize the Pope
of Rome. I was brought up to believe that the Roman
communion was a half-pagan, half-political body,
which had corrupted the Gospel with idolatry and
superstition, and forfeited its right to be called a
Christian Church.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Hero&#8217;s turn to be astonished as she listened
to the language of an extinct generation. Brought
up in the age which had witnessed the triumph of the
Ritualist propaganda, it was news to her that the
national Church had ever occupied any attitude but
one of envious imitation or suppliant apology towards
that of Rome. And yet Hero Vanbrugh was a girl
who had read a good deal, travelled much, and used
her own powers of observation and reasoning. She
had seen the ignorant priesthoods of Spain and Italy,
and their brutish flocks, the most degraded element
in the European population. The sight of the Rev.
Aloysius Grimes cringing to Mike Finigan had roused
her indignation. And yet the spectacle of a great
society of Grimeses cringing to Mike Finigan&#8217;s master,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
in the name of Elizabeth&#8217;s and Cromwell&#8217;s countrymen,
had scarcely moved her to a passing sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Times have changed,&#8221; she murmured to the
Duchess.</p>

<p>And times had. Even the Duchess realized dimly
that it had become unsafe to utter aloud her sentiments
of loyalty to the English Church or to the English
Throne in a Church of England schoolroom,
while it had ceased to be unsafe for Dr. Coles to parade
openly his treason to both. His episcopal character
was no secret in the theological colleges from
which a steady stream of young men like the Rev.
Aloysius turned their steps to the obscure Lambeth
Vicarage in search of those supernatural powers
which they deemed the neighbouring Archbishop had
no power to bestow. In this way the whole Church
was being gradually leavened, so that the time was
at hand when some portion of the mysterious virtue
brought from Armenia would have found its way into
all the channels of ordination, and obstinate Evangelicals
would be receiving Armenian Orders unknown
to themselves, and would be working the great
Transubstantiation miracle in which they personally
did not believe.</p>

<p>For the sake of achieving this object Dr. Coles
had put on one side the prospect of promotion in
the English Church. With abilities sufficient to have
raised him perhaps to the House of Lords, he had
deliberately accepted the part of priest of an obscure
parish, content if his underground revolution was allowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
to proceed without interference. His motives
were mixed, perhaps, but great revolutions are the
result of mixed motives, and never of wholly small
and base ones. The Vicar of St. Jermyn&#8217;s was blinded
to the degrading character of his methods by the
loftiness of his aims. He took the guilt of fraud and
perjury on his conscience, and he did so contentedly,
looking forward to the time when the Church he
served would re-enter the Catholic unity, and the Body
of Christ be made whole.</p>

<p>As soon as he had finished receiving the homage of
his peculiar adherents, the old priest went up to the
Duchess of Trent, for whom he had a warm regard.
In spite of the theological gulf that sundered them,
she commanded his sympathy far more than the vain
and hysterical women who grovelled in his confessional,
and her simple and unselfish piety displayed
in those good works which all religions enjoin had
won his gratitude and respect. Had he been able to
make a convert of the Duchess he would have felt
it as great a triumph as when the State-appointed
Bishop of Linchester, laying aside his jewelled crozier
and mitre, came and knelt in the humble study of St.
Jermyn&#8217;s Vicarage to receive them again at the hands
of the &#8220;Bishop of Lambeth.&#8221;</p>

<p>On her side the Duchess was not blind to the merits
of Dr. Coles, his indefatigable zeal, unworldliness,
and kindly temper. They met as friends meet, seated
in different trains, and going in opposite directions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
who exchange a brief word of greeting before they
pass out of each other&#8217;s sight.</p>

<p>The Duchess had never referred to the religious
aberrations of the Doctor, but she thought she might
safely challenge him on the subject of loyalty to the
Throne.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had no idea that you sympathized with the
Legitimists,&#8221; she observed.</p>

<p>The Vicar smiled indulgently.</p>

<p>&#8220;This bazaar, I suppose you mean? It is more
Father Grimes&#8217;s doing than mine. I hold entirely
aloof from politics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you have lent your schoolroom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Coles frowned.</p>

<p>&#8220;My schoolroom, as you call it, is a public building,&#8221;
he said, with a touch of anger. &#8220;I find I am
expected to lend it for the purposes of political meetings,
even to the party which almost openly aims at
Disestablishment. I sometimes wonder I don&#8217;t receive
an application to lend it for an infidel lecture.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess was impressed. Dr. Coles had struck
the one note which brought them into perfect accord,
in his reference to infidelity.</p>

<p>In the view of the Duchess this was the one thing
worse than Popery. Her religious scale was made
up of five degrees. At the very bottom came Infidelity,
in which term she was disposed to include the
Unitarian denomination and those divines of her own
Church whose Hebrew studies had led them to take
different views as to the authorship of the Old Testament<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
books from those at one time prevalent. The
second head, Popery, covered practically the whole
Christian Church during the ages between the death
of Paul and the conversion of Martin Luther, and
two-thirds of existing Christendom. The third division,
under the word Idolatry, embraced the religions
of the rest of mankind, including the stern monotheists
of Islam. The Jews formed a class apart;
the Duchess was too good a Conservative to blame
that ancient race severely for their stubbornness in
resisting even a Divine reform; she regarded them as
a species of embryo Christians, whose development
had been arrested in the caterpillar stage. Her fifth
division, Protestantism, applied to the sects dating
from the Lutheran revolt, and to stray heretics of the
past, such as the Socialist Lollards and the freethinking
Albigeois, who possessed the merit of having been
persecuted by Rome. Among these, of course, she
distinguished between the converted Christian and the
much larger class of sinners for whom she wished to
take for granted a death-bed repentance.</p>

<p>It was not an unimportant matter that the Duchess
of Trent should have held these views. Money is
always important, and the Duchess was one of a very
large moneyed class who were always ready to open
their purses on behalf of their favourite propaganda.
The infidel and the sinner were supposed to be reached
by the ordinary machinery of the Church, and the
Papist and the Jew had been wellnigh abandoned as
hopeless, though a few Englishmen of the lower class<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
still prowled through countries like Spain and Portugal,
distributing Protestant tracts and increasing the
dislike felt for their nation. But the great field for
missionary effort, of course, was that section of mankind
labelled idolaters or heathen. In the spirit of
the hymn which singles out the inoffensive Buddhists
of Ceylon to brand them with the epithet vile, the
good Duchess firmly believed that to thrust, not merely
the theology, but the morals, social customs, marriage
institutions, language, manners, and even clothing
of her own age and country upon all the peoples
of the earth was a Divine injunction to be neglected
at her peril.</p>

<p>This generous zeal had long been encouraged by
the statesmen of the Raj, who saw its possessions widened
without the expense of arms. The British Empire
resembles no other that has ever existed in having
come into existence unconsciously. England has sent
forth her outlaws on the shores of distant continents,
and they have come back soldiers for her. Her merchants
have gone forth seeking merchandise, and
realms Alexander sighed for have fallen like ripe fruit
into their hands. Her missionaries have Anglicized
where they should have Christianized; the bigoted
worshippers of Allah and Vishnu imitate the language
of Macaulay, and every new church in Africa gives a
new cotton-mill to Lancashire.</p>

<p>Dr. Coles had a more personal argument in store
for the Duchess of Trent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely you cannot be very bigoted against the Legitimists,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
he urged. &#8220;I thought that all the old
Scotch families were Jacobites at heart. And Lord
Alistair Stuart is a member of the Guild.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard my mistress, the Queen, say: &#8216;I
am the greatest Jacobite of them all,&#8217;&#8221; the Duchess
responded. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t think she ever expected to
hear of real Jacobites in the twentieth century. I
don&#8217;t take your friends very seriously, Dr. Coles, and
I dare say my son doesn&#8217;t either.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before the discussion could be carried further Alistair
himself came into view. His mother watched
him anxiously, half afraid of seeing him accord the
same homage to Dr. Coles as the others. But whether
because he was wanting in reverence for Armenia, or
because he was ashamed to show greater respect to a
man than to his own mother, Stuart contented himself
with shaking hands with the priest, after he had
previously greeted his parent.</p>

<p>He was surprised at first to see her at such a function.
But the diplomacy of the Duchess was very
transparent. She at once turned to Hero, and pronounced
the formula which entitles two people in
English society to know of each other&#8217;s existence.</p>

<p>It was the first time Alistair had seen Miss Vanbrugh,
but not the first time he had heard her name.
The eyes of society are very keen where a man like
the Duke of Trent and Colonsay is concerned, and
its whispering-gallery is very wide. Although the
Duke himself had never given any significance to his
intercourse with Hero, the correct significance had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
already been given to it by others, and the rumour
had reached Lord Alistair. For him the girl who
stood before him was the girl who was on the point
of becoming his brother&#8217;s betrothed.</p>

<p>He raised his eyes to her face, and when he saw
that picture of calm, sweet maidenhood, with all the
bloom of youth and purity upon it, and those eyes
radiant with high and happy thoughts, and when he
recalled that other face he had just quitted, with the
paint peeling off under the haggard eyes, and the
cracked lips set in a querulous scowl because he had
not dared to bring her into the company of reputable
women, and when he compared his own lot, cast with
that unhappy creature, with the life that lay before
his brother, blest in so dear a wife, then his heart
failed him, and he had to turn away his eyes to hide
the unexpected smart.</p>

<p>On her part Hero was not much less moved. She
saw standing before her the figure around which her
imagination had already woven its romance, and he
was handsomer than the hero of her romance. The
gracefully-knit form, with its statuesque neck and curling
dark hair, breathed the very spirit of the lays
of Oisin. The swish of the heather was still in his
elastic tread, the sunlight of the rain-washed Hebrides
was in his glance. She seemed to see him in
his kilt and plaid, the eagle&#8217;s feather nodding in his
bonnet, and the claymore by his side, a young chieftain
of the glens, starting at daybreak from his bed
among the fern, and setting forth perhaps to woo a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
maiden like herself with the immemorial charms of
song and dance. In the strait garb of the decorous
capital he seemed to her like a shorn Samson, and she
thought of violets fading in a city garret, and skylarks
caged in a dark cellar beating their wings in
want of light and air.</p>

<p>She, also, drew her comparison, and the cold and
perfect courtier of Colonsay House suffered by it.
For the first time she felt in its full strength that instinct
of self-sacrifice which lies at the core of every
noble nature. The task which Stuart&#8217;s mother had
offered to her, and in which she had only taken a
sentimental interest, now became a fascination. The
longing to save this glorious soul, fallen among weeds
and briars, to lift it up and wipe away its stains, and
set it on its true path again, overcame her like the
touch of love; the touch of love overcame her like
the longing to save, and her hand trembled in Alistair
Stuart&#8217;s.</p>

<p>The two Vanes sidled up, anxious to be recognized
by their chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;So glad you have turned up, Stuart,&#8221; bleated the
elder. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite a demonstration, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Wickham echoed, &#8220;it is a blow. I think we
are striking a blow.&#8221;</p>

<p>He meant at the hated middle classes. It was the
only kind of a blow he was ever likely to strike against
that or any other enemy.</p>

<p>Stuart heard them with impatience. Somehow the
presence of Hero made the two brothers look tawdry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
and ridiculous with their decadent cant, their untidy
hair, and their silly, outlandish neckties. He answered
with irony:</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt the middle classes will be frightened
when they hear of this bazaar. But you must see
that it gets into the papers, otherwise the effect will
be lost. Are there any reporters here?&#8221;</p>

<p>The brothers looked around a little nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; said Egerton, whose vanity was
slightly greater than his cowardice.</p>

<p>&#8220;It might vulgarize the thing,&#8221; suggested Wickham
whose cowardice was slightly greater than his
vanity.</p>

<p>Stuart understood their fears, and played on them
by way of distraction from his secret emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect the place is crammed with detectives,&#8221;
he observed. &#8220;I fancied I saw one or two suspicious-looking
fellows with notebooks as I came in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hero grasped the situation, and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; do you think so?&#8221; exclaimed the elder Vane
in a tone of exultation, tempered by alarm. &#8220;But
surely there is nothing they can take hold of&mdash;nothing
illegal, I mean&mdash;in a bazaar?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They may shadow us after this, though,&#8221; muttered
the junior, in whom alarm had got the better of
exultation.</p>

<p>&#8220;They may treat the bazaar as evidence of a conspiracy,&#8221;
Stuart suggested cheerfully. &#8220;But here
comes St. Maur; you had better ask him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned, and led Hero away through the crowd,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
to escape from the person he had indicated, leaving
the brothers in a state of cruel apprehension.</p>

<p>But Mr. St. Maur was not to be shaken off so
easily. This gentleman, who had spelt his name
&#8220;Maher&#8221; in his native city of &#8220;Dahblin&#8221; (as he was
accustomed to pronounce it), was the son of a decent
butter-merchant, who had put him to the Bar. Coming
over to the Temple, in accordance with old custom
to keep his terms, the ambitious youth was surprised
and charmed to find that his membership of
the Roman Church, which had stood somewhat in
his light in the society of the Irish capital, was here
a fashionable distinction. To drink the Roman Pontiff&#8217;s
health before that of the British Sovereign appeared
to be in some mysterious way a passport to
Court favour, and a Roman missionary had just been
given precedence over the heads of the English
Church. The policy of the Primrose League had
been adapted to the purposes of proselytism, and a
club had been founded in the West End in which the
middle-class aspirant could enjoy the privilege of
lunching in the same room as a Roman Cabinet Minister
and receiving the <i>Times</i> fresh from the hands
of a Roman Duke. Unfortunately the Duke and the
Cabinet Minister failed to play their parts with sufficient
zeal, or else there were not enough of them to
go around, and St. Bridget&#8217;s Club gradually sunk
from depth to depth till not merely Protestants, but
Jews, profaned its portals, and it became a refuge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
for all the suspicious characters whom other clubs
refused.</p>

<p>Young Maher was not long in deciding to forsake
the Irish Bar for the English, and a slight alteration
in the spelling of his name enabled him to pose as
an offshoot of one of the greatest families in Britain.
The difficulty of an accent which clove obstinately to
his tongue was met by a well-constructed legend of
an Irish branch of the family in question, supposed
to have settled in the Emerald Isle about the time
of Strongbow. On the strength of this genealogy,
which would have done credit to the Heralds&#8217; College
in its best remunerated moments, Mr. St. Maur
was in the habit of referring to a nobleman of lofty
rank as &#8220;the head of our house,&#8221; thereby causing intolerable
anguish to his friends, the Vanes, who were
only nephews of a baronet. Unfortunately they were
prevented from questioning the genuineness of St.
Maur&#8217;s pedigree, inasmuch as they had laid every
stress upon it in introducing him to their acquaintance.
But they had an uneasy sense that the Irishman was
an impostor who had beaten them by mere bluff.</p>

<p>On his part the barrister having, as he conceived,
surpassed the Vanes, was seeking for loftier heights
to scale. As soon as he met Lord Alistair Stuart in
the brothers&#8217; flat he promptly marked him out for
attack. Undaunted by Stuart&#8217;s evident dislike for
him, the Irishman persistently forced himself on his
notice. With this object he had thrown himself heart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
and soul into the Legitimist cause, as he would have
thrown himself into the Independent Labour Party
the day after if the leaders of that movement had been
members of the peerage.</p>

<p>Having come to the bazaar chiefly in order to push
his acquaintance with Lord Alistair, Mr. St. Maur
was not the man to be balked of his prey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grand success, this, isn&#8217;t it, Stuart?&#8221; he bawled
out from afar, as he hustled his way through the
throng.</p>

<p>Much as Stuart disliked his follower, he failed to
give him credit for the naked singleness of his aims.
Had he fully understood the Irishman&#8217;s character, he
would have got rid of him before this by the easy
expedient of introducing him to his brother. Once
anchored to the coat-tails of a Duke, St. Maur would
have left a mere younger brother severely alone. As
it was, Lord Alistair saw no way of repelling the
intruder except by a harshness which was not in his
nature.</p>

<p>Mr. St. Maur shook hands effusively, and then,
finding he was not going to be introduced to Lord
Alistair&#8217;s companion, began enlarging on the prospects
of the movement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I consider this affair will launch us as a serious
party,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;The public will begin to reckon
with us. It will soon be time to think of a Parliamentary
candidature. What do you say, Stuart?&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair shrugged his shoulders.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>&#8220;I should think you would get about ten votes in
any constituency in England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but what about Scotland? There is a feeling
up there that might be appealed to. If a man like
yourself, now, a member of an old Highland family,
were to stand in your own part of the country, don&#8217;t
you think the clansmen would rally round you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget that I should have my brother&#8217;s
influence dead against me. He is a member of the
Government.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would have to disavow you officially, of
course. But privately, you know? Don&#8217;t you think
the Duke might be brought to show some sympathy
for the movement?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would simply laugh at it, I expect,&#8221; said
Stuart.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duke of Gloucester does not laugh at it,&#8221;
returned the other.</p>

<p>Alistair&#8217;s face darkened at the name, and he cast
down his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>St. Maur swelled with importance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I happen to have private information that he
watches the proceedings of the Guild with the closest
attention. He has everything that appears in the
press about us sent him by a press-cutting agency.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I had known that before,&#8221; said Alistair.
And, turning to Hero, he explained: &#8220;I have let
them have an autograph letter of the Prince&#8217;s to sell
at one of the stalls.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>The absurdity of this did not strike Hero so much
as its ingratitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;A letter from the Prince to you, do you mean?&#8221;
she asked, with an accent of reproach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I used to know him very well when we were
boys. I came across it the other day among some
old papers. But I shouldn&#8217;t like him to hear that I
had let it be sold.&#8221;</p>

<p>A purpose had swiftly formed in Hero&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whereabouts is the stall?&#8221; she inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Over here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Turning his back on Mr. St. Maur with unwonted
rudeness, he conducted Hero to a stall presided over
by a pretty, overdressed little woman, who had been
persuaded by Mr. Grimes in the confessional that
she would thus atone for certain errors to which pretty,
overdressed little women are prone. Prince Herbert&#8217;s
autograph had been entrusted to her for sale,
and by good luck it had not been disposed of when
the two came up.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the price of this letter?&#8221; Miss Vanbrugh
asked quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;One guinea,&#8221; the stallkeeper simpered. &#8220;It is
from His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester to
Lord Alistair Stuart,&#8221; she added in ignorance of who
stood before her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me buy it, and give it to you!&#8221; cried Alistair,
guessing Hero&#8217;s design.</p>

<p>She took up the letter. It was a short schoolboy&#8217;s
note, and contained a misspelt word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Alistair</span>:</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot meet you to-morrow, as the Crown
Prince of Austria is coming, but I will go out fishing
on Saturday if you like. Come over here at ten
o&#8217;clock&mdash;mind, be punctual.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">&#8220;Yours affectionately,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Herbert</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;P.S.&mdash;Sorry to break my promise, but they made
me. Mind, bring your fishing-rod.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Hero handed the letter to her companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather you let me buy it, and give it back
to you,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>She handed the money to the lady of the stall, who
was looking considerably astonished.</p>

<p>Alistair understood the delicate rebuke. His glance
took in the contents of the friendly, boyish note
afresh, and he felt ashamed that he had parted with
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very grateful to you, Miss Vanbrugh, believe
me,&#8221; he said earnestly, as he slipped the letter into
his pocket. &#8220;I ought not to have let it go into strange
hands. But I hope I needn&#8217;t count you as a stranger.
You are often at Colonsay House, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never met you there,&#8221; said Hero pointedly.</p>

<p>And Alistair was silent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Miracle Play was a great success, though not,
perhaps, in the way anticipated by Dr. Coles.</p>

<p>The Vicar had understood that the text of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
Ober-Ammergau performance was to furnish the basis
of a version only slightly modified by Mr. Egerton
Vane. But Mr. Vane, being deeply imbued with the
spirit of Maeterlinck, had allowed his adaptation to
become tinctured to an unforeseen extent by the vein
of symbolism peculiar to the work of the Belgian
master. The orthodox Christian interpretation being
repugnant to his feelings as a Pagan, he had, moreover,
boldly replaced it by something more congenial
to his own sympathies.</p>

<p>The result was somewhat as though a conscientious
Buddhist should rewrite &#8220;Paradise Lost,&#8221; endeavouring
to make it illustrate the doctrine of metempsychosis.</p>

<p>In the opening scene Mary was introduced as the
Spirit of Form, receiving the Annunciation from the
Angel Gabriel as the representative of Creative Genius.
The dialogue, which was fortunately unintelligible
to nine-tenths of the audience, turned on the
sterility of the Jewish nation in the department of
the plastic arts. Mary was informed that her Son
would remove the prohibition contained in the Second
Commandment, thereby opening the way for the
Christian school of statuary and painting.</p>

<p>The whole of the sacred narrative was dealt with
from the same standpoint. The Wise Men were
presented as the exponents of the three arts of Poetry,
Music, and Painting, whose respective merits were
discussed at some length. The dispute of the child
Christ in the Temple was made to turn on Keats&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
famous identification of Truth with Beauty. Satan,
in the scene of the Temptation, appeared as the genius
of Utilitarianism and the middle classes, urging
the Christ to abandon the principle of Art for Art&#8217;s
sake. Towards the end of the drama Byron&#8217;s jest
about Barabbas was almost literally incorporated,
Barabbas being designed as a type of commercial success
in literature&mdash;a Jewish Tennyson or Ruskin.</p>

<p>Every allusion to the Jews as a people was barbed
with the bitterest malignity. The Semitic spirit was
branded, with some historical confusion, as that of
Philistinism <i>par excellence</i>; and Isaiah and other
prophets were ingeniously represented as having
fallen martyrs to their literary excellence rather than
to their reforming energy.</p>

<p>The allegory was so vague and the dialogue so obscure
that most of those present entirely failed to
grasp the enormity of the author&#8217;s transgression. But
it was otherwise with Dr. Coles. The Armenian
proselyte was a learned and thorough-going medievalist,
and he had taken it for granted that medieval
traditions would be strictly adhered to. He had left
the work of superintending the rehearsals to his curate,
never deeming that Mr. Grimes was capable
of betraying the trust. Nor was he, had he been
sufficiently intelligent to perceive that he was being
made a cat&#8217;s-paw by his pagan librettist. The actors
in the piece, being the choir-boys, were even less capable
of judging of the drift of the performance.</p>

<p>The deeply mortified Vicar restrained his wrath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
till the moment when the High-Priest Caiaphas came
upon the scene in the thinly-disguised character of
the proprietor of a morning paper with an enormous
circulation, when it became impossible to mistake the
dramatist&#8217;s intentions. Rising from his seat in the
front row of the audience, Dr. Coles gave a peremptory
order for the curtain to be let down, and the
thoroughly mystified spectators seized the opportunity
to escape.</p>

<small>MOLLY FINUCANE AT HOME</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> he turned away from St. Jermyn&#8217;s schoolroom,
after putting his mother and Miss Vanbrugh into
their carriage, Lord Alistair Stuart made a curious
discovery. Thrusting his hands into his pocket in
the act of nodding to a cabdriver, he found that he
had no money.</p>

<p>The brother of the Duke of Trent and Colonsay
had often known what it was to want a thousand
pounds, but he had never been without sovereigns in
his pocket, and it took him some moments to realize
that this state of things was not accidental, but natural
in his new circumstances.</p>

<p>Much to his own surprise, he felt the first cold
touch of poverty distinctly exhilarating, like a bather&#8217;s
first plunge into the sea. It was not hardship so
far; it was merely adventure. He apologized to the
disappointed cabman, and set off to walk to Chelsea,
with that sense of superiority to fortune which Aristippus
may have felt when he bade his tired slave
throw away the bag of gold.</p>

<p>Voluntary suffering has always exercised a powerful
charm over a certain order of mankind. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
starvation, the confinement, and the self-torture of the
Hindu fakir and the Catholic saint have not been
practised solely with a business-like view to reward
in a future life; they have satisfied a need&mdash;morbid,
perhaps, but real, since it is found among races that
have scarcely risen to the conception of another world.
It is as if diseased human nature instinctively sought
its own remedy, as the suffering animal seeks out the
herb possessed of healing powers.</p>

<p>As Alistair Stuart took his way through the mean
streets of Lambeth and Vauxhall, with their narrow
dirty pavements, their scanty shops at the street-corners
and their taverns in which the only touches of
brightness and prosperity seemed concentrated, he felt
the temptation growing strong upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all, it would not be so bad to live this life,&#8221;
he said to himself. &#8220;One might be very cosy in one
of these small old houses, tucked up against some
great dead wall, with unknown things taking place
on the other side of it, or buried beneath some huge
railway arch, with trains thundering overhead all
night to unknown destinations. I seem to be an outlaw;
why shouldn&#8217;t I live among outlaws? I could
loaf about in flannel shirts and dressing-gowns all day
long, and Molly would fetch me my beer from the
public-house. I should smoke long clay pipes, and
write an epic poem, like the &#8216;City of Dreadful
Night.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>But the recollection of Thomson and his poem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
turned the current of his thoughts into a darker
channel.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many men of genius has London brained
with her paving-stones!&#8221; he reflected bitterly. &#8220;The
poet asks for nothing but liberty to sing, and the
world will not give it to him. &#8216;Give me money&#8217;s
worth for my bread and raiment and shelter&#8217; is her
harsh demand; and she drags the poet from his
fountain in the wilderness to sweep the dust of the
bazaar.&#8221;</p>

<p>His fellow-feeling for the poor drunken schoolmaster
rested on sentiment. In Alistair the seed of genius,
delicate from the first, had been choked, not by
the pressure of physical needs, but by a profound
moral discouragement. During the years in which
genius begins to recognize itself, to try its wings, and
point its first shy flight towards the empyrean, he
had found himself living the life of a criminal on a
ticket-of-leave. He had been kept in a state of spiritual
starvation, deprived of the food for which his
nature pined, and choked with the dry bread of Calvinism.
The budding tendrils of his mind had shrivelled,
vainly searching for the air of sympathy and
the warm sun of praise. He had been made to feel
afraid of his own intelligence, his dreams and guesses
after truth and beauty were imputed to him as iniquity;
and if he ever sought to give them expression,
he wrote as Crusoe might have written on his desert
isle&mdash;for the ears of savages.</p>

<p>His genius had emerged from this ordeal maimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
for life. If he sang now, it was not as the birds sang,
rejoicing in their Maker&#8217;s gift to them, but stealthily,
as prisoners sing in dungeons, apprehensive of the
passing warder&#8217;s tread. Even the desire for fame
was now a broken spring. He had tasted too deeply
of the bitter cup of disapproval to hope to cleanse
his mouth with the honey of applause. He felt
vaguely that he had been sent into the world to teach
his fellow-men to rejoice with him in all its beauty
and its wonder, and that they had struck him brutally
across the lips, and bidden him become dull and timid
and mean-hearted, like themselves.</p>

<p>A whole generation in England had endured an
experience more or less like Alistair&#8217;s, and the literature
of the age still breathes a suppressed bitterness
against the cruelties of Evangelicalism. The persecution
was all the more oppressive because it was not
sanctioned by any public authority, nor embodied in
any law. It was carried on privately, around every
hearth, and in every hour of family life, poisoning
the springs of truthfulness and self-respect, and breaking
the hearts of the young. It was the memory of
such wrongs that had made easy the triumph of the
Catholic reaction; the Protestant tyranny had fallen,
as other tyrannies fall, more by its own abuses than
by the strength of its assailants. The fires of Smithfield
were forgotten, and the little pagan group who
surrounded Alistair Stuart patronized the Roman
Church as their most powerful ally against the Nonconformist
conscience.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>But Alistair was beginning to look deeper. The
play he had just witnessed, in spite of its absurdities,
had embodied certain sentiments of his own. &#8220;There
is no cure,&#8221; he reflected as he walked along. &#8220;There
is no help for men like me; the crowd will always
persecute us. They have set up the image of the
Crucified One that they might crucify others in his
name. The memory of Otway did not save Chatterton;
the sufferings of Chatterton did not redeem
Poe. Their flattery of the dead is only a deeper insult
to the living. They kneel at the tomb of Shakespeare,
and if Shakespeare rose again they would
cast him into Reading Gaol.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Alistair Stuart&#8217;s misfortune to be only a
half-hearted sinner. The world likes its men to be
thorough-going. Confronted with a mixed individuality
it is disconcerted and annoyed, like a reviewer
called upon to judge a poem by a prose-writer, or a
serious volume from a humorist&#8217;s pen. Alistair&#8217;s
natural instincts had been cowed by his boyish experience.
Without sharing the convictions of the righteous,
he lacked the courage to despise them utterly.
He would have had them pardon him, though he
could not repent.</p>

<p>His embittered mood lasted till he came in sight
of the river below Battersea Park. The sunlight
sparkling on the water, and the fresh breeze blowing
over the trees of the park, refreshed him for the
moment, and his thoughts turned to Hero Vanbrugh.</p>

<p>A sigh rose to his lips.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>&#8220;If I had only met her a year ago!&#8221;</p>

<p>The rebuke which Hero had administered so delicately
in the matter of the royal autograph had moved
him to the heart. It had been an appeal to his self-respect,
a proof that she credited him with honourable
instincts like her own, and at this crisis in his life
the compliment was like the touch of balm upon a
sore. With such a hand as Hero&#8217;s to restrain him,
that plunge into the social underworld which he was
contemplating lost its fascination. How was it that
in all the years they had known him neither his
mother nor his brother had ever been able to strike
the chord which this girl&#8217;s finger had touched unerringly
at their first meeting?</p>

<p>In searching for the answer to this riddle, he recollected
whither his steps were bound. The figure of
Molly Finucane rose before him like a faded portrait
over which a breath of discoloration had passed,
leaving it tarnished and dingy, and he shivered
slightly, and unconsciously relaxed the quickness of
his pace.</p>

<p>His heart sank within him as he ascended the familiar
path, and let himself in with his latchkey.
Missing the expected figure of the page, he hung up
his hat himself, and passed into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Tom?&#8221; he inquired, not without some
foreboding of the reply he should receive.</p>

<p>Molly was lying on the sofa in a low-necked dress,
pulling a cigarette, and trying to amuse herself with
an illustrated ladies&#8217; paper, which did not amuse her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
at all&mdash;it was much too severe in its decorum. She
sat up yawning at Stuart&#8217;s entrance, and frowned as
he put his question.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had to get rid of him for insolence,&#8221; she replied,
with still smouldering wrath. &#8220;I told him my shoes
hadn&#8217;t been cleaned this morning, and the young brat
contradicted me to my face, and said he couldn&#8217;t do
them any better. The lazy little wretch hadn&#8217;t
touched them. I asked him if he knew who he was
talking to, and he became insolent. So I just ordered
him to pack up and leave the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stuart listened without much interest to this story,
the counterpart of which he had often heard before.
Somehow Molly&#8217;s servants were perpetually incurring
dismissal for similar behaviour. It was rare for her
to keep them more than a couple of months, and it
was not uncommon for them to be sent away the day
after they arrived; and always for the same cause&mdash;disrespect
to the mistress of the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think what&#8217;s the matter with the servants
nowadays,&#8221; Molly complained. She was not the only
mistress to whom it had never occurred that there
could be, by any possibility, a servants&#8217; side to the
great question. &#8220;I had a Scotchwoman here to-day,
applying for the cook&#8217;s place&#8221;&mdash;the cook had been
under notice to leave for some time&mdash;&#8220;and she was
most impertinent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Molly stopped rather unexpectedly, as though she
had been going to give particulars of the impertinence,
but had suddenly thought better of it. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
Scotchwoman, in fact, had presumed so far as to inquire
into the character of the relationship between
the lady of the house and the Lord Alistair Stuart
who was indicated as its master, and had withdrawn
her candidature for the situation on learning that the
tie was merely one of friendship. Being told rather
fiercely by Miss Finucane that this was not her business,
the offender had replied uncompromisingly:
&#8220;Excuse me, miss, I don&#8217;t set up to blame you, but I
have my character to think of, and if it was known
that I had taken a place in a house that wasn&#8217;t respectable,
I might not be able to suit myself elsewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was no doubt the irritation caused by this plain
speaking which had vented itself on the unlucky page.
Alistair shrugged his shoulders as though in sympathy,
but inwardly the question suggested itself whether
Miss Vanbrugh ever had to encounter insolence on
the part of servants. He did not think it likely.</p>

<p>He had to go upstairs to dress for dinner, this
being a point about which Miss Finucane was very
particular. If ever a man ventured to present himself
at her dinner-table in morning dress she was apt
to take it as a carefully studied reflection on her character.
Her own time hung so heavily on her hands
that she spent half her day over her wardrobe. She
breakfasted in a fur-lined dressing-gown, put on a
walking-dress during the morning, lunched in a third
costume, wore an &aelig;sthetic tea-gown in the afternoon,
made a grand toilet for dinner, and exchanged it for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
a loose night-robe in which she drank whisky and
water before going to bed. In all these changes of
costume jewels played a great part. Diamonds and
sapphires meant to Molly much what a table well covered
with briefs means to a barrister, or the strips of
ribbon on his breast to a soldier; they were the tangible
tokens of success.</p>

<p>When Stuart came downstairs there was no sign
of dinner. He sat down and tried to talk to Molly
about the bazaar, but she listened sulkily, offended
because he had not ventured to take her with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There were lots of women there, I suppose?&#8221; she
asked, in a grumbling voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a good many. Women belonging to the
Church, most of them, I expect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was there anyone you knew?&#8221;</p>

<p>She fixed a shrewdly questioning glance on him, and
noted the momentary hesitation that preceded his
reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Molly gave a scornful smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lie, Alistair. Was your mother there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I prefer not to talk about my mother,&#8221; returned
Alistair, who dreaded Molly&#8217;s coarse tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I didn&#8217;t know why you wouldn&#8217;t
take me?&#8221; Molly retorted. &#8220;Who else was there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one I had ever met before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Molly pounced on the concealed admission.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mother introduced you to someone. Who
was it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>Stuart rose to his feet, beginning to get angry.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only woman I spoke to the whole afternoon
was a young lady who, I believe, is going to marry
my brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s her name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I decline to tell you.&#8221; He walked over to the bell
and rang it impatiently. &#8220;What the deuce are they
keeping dinner for?&#8221;</p>

<p>Molly sat silent, watching him with all the cunning
of a narrow intelligence concentrated on one
point. No one in the world was more ignorant than
Molly Finucane was of the things that are written
about in books, but the keenest counsel who ever sifted
the evidence of a lying witness could not have
matched the sureness with which she detected anything
in Alistair&#8217;s mind that threatened her supremacy
over him. Her instinct now warned her that
some danger had arisen for her, and her fear, overpowering
her jealousy for the moment, made her
hold her tongue.</p>

<p>No notice was taken of Lord Alistair&#8217;s ring, but
after another ten minutes or so an untidy parlour-maid
put her head into the room and announced that
dinner was ready.</p>

<p>The dinner was badly cooked, and not appetising,
and the parlour-maid had neglected to warm the
claret. Molly called for champagne.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s none left, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; the maid retorted,
speaking in that hostile tone which her servants generally
assumed towards Miss Finucane.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>&#8220;Yes, there is, unless you&#8217;ve drunk it in the
kitchen.&#8221;</p>

<p>An altercation between mistress and maid followed,
high words being used on both sides. Stuart went
on with his dinner in silent disgust, trying not to
listen. He had sat through similar scenes often
enough before, but they had not made the same impression
on him. It was as though his whole nature
had been set throbbing like a bell with a certain note,
with which his surroundings were all out of tune.</p>

<p>The dinner was not only badly cooked, but it quickly
appeared that there was not enough of it. On seeing
a few slices of ham set before her in the place
of a joint, the mistress of the house lost her temper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and tell the cook to make an omelette,&#8221; she
ordered angrily. &#8220;It&#8217;s disgraceful that we can&#8217;t have
enough to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>The parlour-maid departed. A minute or two
afterwards the door was flung open violently, and the
cook advanced into the middle of the dining-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t have an omelette. I&#8217;ve no eggs, and
the fire&#8217;s gone out,&#8221; she remarked loudly and aggressively.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, cook?&#8221; said Molly, evidently
rather alarmed.</p>

<p>The cook saw her mistress quailing, and raised her
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that I&#8217;ve cooked as much as I mean to,
and I&#8217;m not going to do any more. I&#8217;m tired of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is disgraceful!&#8221; exclaimed her mistress, appealing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
to Stuart. &#8220;You ought to be ashamed of
yourself, to come in and talk like that, simply because
I asked for an omelette.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you can&#8217;t have it, then,&#8221; the cook returned,
with a ring of triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well; that&#8217;s enough. Go downstairs!&#8221; commanded
Molly.</p>

<p>The cook tossed her head, and marched out of the
room, slamming the door behind her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you owe the woman any wages?&#8221; Stuart asked,
as soon as she was gone. He knew by experience that
it was useless to interfere in these periodical scenes
between Molly and her household.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a farthing,&#8221; Molly protested. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve
always treated her kindly, too. I can&#8217;t think what
makes her presume like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cook went down fuming and snorting into the
kitchen, and gave the explanation to her sympathizing
sisters.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll teach her to send haughty messages out to
me, and me a respectable woman whose father had
a farm, and six men under him; and her out of the
gutter, and no better than a street-walker, if you come
to that, though she do ride in her carriage, and wear
as many jewels as a Martinet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean a Marchioness, don&#8217;t you, Eleanor?&#8221;
inquired the housemaid, who had moved in higher
spheres.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean a lady, that&#8217;s what I mean,&#8221; said the cook,
with grim emphasis. &#8220;Consequently I don&#8217;t mean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
Miss Finucane, as she calls herself, though her real
name&#8217;s Finigan, and she&#8217;s low Irish down to her
boot-soles.&#8221; She took a long breath, and concluded:
&#8220;And so I&#8217;d have told her to her face if his lordship
hadn&#8217;t been there; but he&#8217;s a gentleman, when all&#8217;s
said and done, and I&#8217;m sorry for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cook spoke for her sex. Most women were
sorry for Lord Alistair Stuart.</p>

<p>When Molly saw Alistair rise from the table immediately
after the cook&#8217;s stormy exit, her face fell.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going out again?&#8221; she protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to,&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take me with you, then,&#8221; Molly demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t. I&#8217;m going to see Des Louvres.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re always going there. What do you want
to see him for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s on business to do with the Legitimists.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bother the Legitimists!&#8221; Molly was not a politician.
Beyond the vague notion that all these pretenders
of whom she heard so much enjoyed the secret
patronage of the Pope, and must therefore be
in some way inimical to that Protestantism which it
had been her first lesson as a child to abjure and
abhor, she was completely indifferent to their cause.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t have you go,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
been out all day, and left me alone with those wretched
servants. I want you to take me to the theatre.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no money,&#8221; said Stuart impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you borrow some?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who from?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>A name rose to Molly&#8217;s lips, but she hesitated to
pronounce it. She looked at Stuart, and as their eyes
met each knew what the other was thinking of.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he declared hastily. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Molly, but
I must go. I promised. There&#8217;s to be somebody
there that I must meet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a sort of secret. You won&#8217;t talk about
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who have I got to talk to?&#8221;</p>

<p>The retort struck painfully on Alistair. That compassion
for Molly which lay at the root of his
refusal to leave her was stirred by the reminder of the
poor little woman&#8217;s loneliness. She had no friends,
she could have no friends in their present circumstances,
and she had no interests in life apart from
him. He felt that he was ill-treating her by this second
absence in one day, and his voice softened as he
explained:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Don Juan. Des Louvres told me he doesn&#8217;t
want it to be known that he&#8217;s in England.&#8221;</p>

<p>The name was not familiar to Molly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221; she asked, more with the object of
detaining Stuart than from any real curiosity on the
subject.</p>

<p>Don Juan, in fact, only ranked as an heir-apparent
in the Legitimist almanac, his father being still alive.
He represented one of those families of decrepit and
priest-ridden despots which were everywhere driven
from the thrones of the Mediterranean by the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
Liberal flood of the nineteenth century. Now the
flood was beginning to abate, the wrongs of the past
were fading from men&#8217;s minds, and the figures of
these discrowned Princes stood forth once more, surrounded
by the halo of romantic misfortune.</p>

<p>But all this did not concern Molly in the least.
Don Juan&#8217;s only importance for her was as a new
acquaintance for Stuart. She took a jealous interest
in all Alistair&#8217;s friends, not as individuals, but as
influences over him which might or might not tend
to detach him from herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you going to meet him?&#8221; she asked,
hardly waiting for the answer to her first question.</p>

<p>Alistair gave a half-ashamed smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he is going to give me a decoration, I believe&mdash;the
Order of the Holy Sepulchre.&#8221;</p>

<p>Molly looked impressed. She was sensitive about
Alistair&#8217;s social position, which she was conscious of
having compromised, and this decoration, coming on
the morrow of his bankruptcy, seemed a welcome
rehabilitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he really is a Prince?&#8221; she asked, with floating
recollections of police-court cases in which adventurers
had obtained money by pretending to titles
not really theirs.</p>

<p>Stuart laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s a Prince right enough; at least, he&#8217;s as
good as the Comte de Rouen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Molly had heard of the Comte de Rouen, whose
party had just given proof of its vitality in a neighbouring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
country in one of the most extraordinary episodes
recorded in history. A conflict, extending over
years, and threatening at one time to assume the character
of a civil war, had taken place between the
heads of the army, on the one hand, and the civil
Government on the other, over the body of an obscure
Jewish officer. If the guilt or innocence of the
victim of this famous persecution had not yet been
placed beyond the reach of doubt, at least it was made
clear that his enemies had steeped themselves in perjury,
forgery, and every kind of subornation and conspiracy.
It became equally evident that the motive
of their action was rather religious than political; a
chasm was revealed running through the nation, and
sharply dividing the clerical persecutors from the
anti-clerical defenders of the accused man. The army
chiefs appeared as the tools of the priesthood, which
was seen in full cry on the trail of a Semitic victim.
The contagion spread to other countries, and prelates
of the Roman Church in England proclaimed
their sympathy with the crusade. A shock ran through
Europe and America. It was as if the mask of saintly
meekness under persecution worn so closely by the
Roman Church for a century had been suddenly lifted
for a moment, and modern men had obtained a
glimpse of the Fury&#8217;s visage underneath, with its
writhing snakes and its teeth gnashing for blood, the
visage which they had almost come to think of as a
fable of Protestant historians.</p>

<p>The name of the Comte de Rouen silenced Molly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
and Alistair was allowed to depart without further
objection.</p>

<p>As soon as he had left the house she went upstairs,
took out his mother&#8217;s letter, and read it through again
for the fourth or fifth time, with her lips tightly
pinched and her forehead wrinkled in the effort to
devise some reply calculated at once to teach the
Duchess manners, and yet to neutralize her opposition.</p>

<p>This was what she wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about Alistair. You are about as
likely to see me marry him as you are to see&#8221;&mdash;she
named a sacred personage&mdash;&#8220;riding down Piccadilly
on a bicycle.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">&#8220;Yours truly,</span><br />

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>A SCIENTIFIC OPINION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Duke of Trent and Colonsay sat at his great
office table in his room at the Home Office thinking.</p>

<p>The table was piled high with official papers. The
permanent staff of a Government Department are
quick to detect the weakness of each new chief put
over their heads by the changing tide of parliamentary
warfare. The weakness of the new Home Secretary
was for details and statistics. A return of a
hundred foolscap pages showing exactly how many
pounds of beef and how many pounds of rice are
consumed in the prisons of the country every year,
or how many miles a policeman tramps over in the
same period in the course of his beat, afforded a real
satisfaction to his intellect. His staff catered for this
taste as if they had been the conductors of a popular
magazine. They kept their new chief busy and contented,
and he let them alone.</p>

<p>But it was not about his important functions in the
State that the Minister was thinking at this moment,
but about a more personal concern.</p>

<p>His discovery of his mother&#8217;s project had left him
for some time in a state of indecision, due partly to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
the fact that his desire was not so much to marry
Hero Vanbrugh as to prevent his brother from marrying
her. The appearance of a rival on the scene
is generally sufficient to decide a hesitating wooer,
but then the Duke had not been exactly a wooer, and
this was another cause of embarrassment. Suddenly
to begin paying the attentions of a lover to a girl
whom he had been accustomed to treat familiarly as
his mother&#8217;s friend seemed to a man of the Duke&#8217;s
stiff habit of mind an awkward, and possibly a ridiculous,
proceeding.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he saw that his mother was
actively pushing her design, and he could not shut
his eyes to the fact that Alistair was a rival to be
feared.</p>

<p>It is difficult at all times for a man with a strong
sense of his own dignity to make love, and for a man
animated by the calm and temperate regard of the
Duke of Trent to try to make love according to the
accepted English convention struck even his imagination
as dangerously foolish.</p>

<p>He condemned in his own mind the national custom
which requires the man to do his own love-making.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, in France,&#8221; he reflected, &#8220;there would be
no trouble about the matter. I should tell my mother
to send for Sir Bernard Vanbrugh, and they would
settle it between them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Bernard&#8217;s name suggested an alternative which
recommended itself the more the longer he considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
it. He would carry his proposal to Hero&#8217;s
father, and leave it to him to break the ice with Hero
herself.</p>

<p>His acquaintance with the great scientist and physician
was of the slightest, but he could hardly distrust
the reception such a son-in-law as himself was
likely to receive, and he might count on the father&#8217;s
influence with his daughter to overcome any possible
hesitation on her part.</p>

<p>Desirous to give every possible distinction to his
overture, the Home Secretary drew towards him a
sheet of the official notepaper, and wrote a few lines
requesting the physician to name an hour at which
he would receive him on a private matter. The note
folded and sealed, he handed it to his private secretary,
with injunctions to send it by a messenger, and
bring back the reply.</p>

<p>Sir Bernard Vanbrugh&#8217;s answer, which arrived
within half an hour, was even more formal than the
Duke&#8217;s request, simply stating that the physician
would be at liberty that day at five o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>The Duke ordered his carriage, and alighted at
Sir Bernard&#8217;s door in Stratford Place punctually at
the hour named. Rather to his surprise, but even
more to his relief, he was taken, not into the drawing-room,
but into the physician&#8217;s consulting-room, and
offered the patient&#8217;s chair.</p>

<p>The man whose grey powerful eyes, under their
square wall of forehead, were turned on him with
something of the penetrative power of a searchlight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
across a fragile-looking desk in some decorative wood,
was a man with a remarkable history.</p>

<p>There are some men of whom their friends are
accustomed to say that they should like them better
if they were not so clever. Vanbrugh had started in
life with this handicap. He was an intellectual monster,
a brain-giant whose understanding was to the
understandings of those about him what the magnesium
light is to a tallow candle.</p>

<p>Those into whose company he was thrown suffered
somewhat as they would have done in a strong light.
Moreover, they were conscious that Vanbrugh silently
looked through them and over them, and they resented
the process in proportion to their conceit of
themselves.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that the ablest man of his time
was the most unpopular.</p>

<p>The unpopularity was the most marked among the
members of his own profession. To Vanbrugh the
usages and traditions of his class were so much rubbish.
He saw in the etiquette of medicine nothing
but the precautions of dunces to protect their incapacity
from discovery. He was unable to make allowance
for that infirmity of the human mind which
clings to custom through sheer terror of the unknown.
Where he ought to have imputed cowardice he imputed
fraud.</p>

<p>He was a revolutionist by sheer force of insight.
His mind covered at a single bound the slow progress
of years, and he was too impatient to wait for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
laggards to catch him up. The stupid are in a great
majority at all times, and in all situations, but some
men, not less great than Vanbrugh, have possessed
the art of coaxing them, and leading them on. It
was just this art that Vanbrugh lacked. Unconscious
of his own brutality, he trampled on folly and dullness
with feet of iron, and the dull and foolish turned
and rent him.</p>

<p>Up to the age of forty Bernard Vanbrugh&#8217;s life
had been one long record of disaster.</p>

<p>As a student he had been deeply unpopular, even
with his professors, who saw that they had in him
a critic rather than a pupil. While still walking the
hospitals, the young man had ventured to argue with
the great lights of the profession whom he was there
to watch reverently and believe implicitly. He had
had the audacity to suggest to a celebrated gynecologist
the use of ice at a critical stage of a well-known
operation; and though the specialist found himself
obliged to act on the advice, and subsequently enhanced
his reputation by adopting the treatment in
his private practice, he never forgave the young man&#8217;s
presumption.</p>

<p>The medical authorities treated Vanbrugh with
strict justice, up to the point at which justice ceased
to be obligatory; that is to say, they awarded him
as examiners every prize for which he chose to enter,
but they refused him a house-surgeoncy. When the
astonished and mortified young man tried to learn
the reason for this refusal, he was met by polite excuses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
and the recommendation that he should start in
practice as a consultant.</p>

<p>One old professor told him the truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our honorary staff will not have you,&#8221; he said
bluntly. &#8220;Not because they haven&#8217;t confidence in you,
but because they think you haven&#8217;t confidence in
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a bitter smile Vanbrugh acknowledged the
justice of the excuse.</p>

<p>He made up his mind that he must accept a house-surgeoncy
in the provinces. But when he came to
apply for the usual testimonials from those who had
superintended his education, he received documents
so frigidly worded as to show clearly that they were
given as a matter of obligation merely, and not with
any good will. The local doctors in whose hands
the appointments lay discerned the actual disapproval
beneath the formal recommendation. Vanbrugh, the
most distinguished student of his year, or for many
years, was not even invited to present himself for
a personal interview when he applied for a post of
two hundred a year in a small country town.</p>

<p>He abandoned this useless attempt without much
regret. He knew well enough that London contained
his destiny, and that he had been guilty of treason to
his own powers in seeking to escape it.</p>

<p>His enemies had advised him to become a consultant&mdash;that
is to say, to take rooms in an expensive
street in the West End, and wait for other doctors
to send him patients as to a superior. Vanbrugh took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
this advice, and for fifteen years no patient ever
crossed his threshold.</p>

<p>A consultant depends absolutely on the support of
his own profession, and in his own profession Vanbrugh
was hated as few men are hated. There were
men who, if they had heard of a patient intending
to consult him, would have walked across London to
prevent it.</p>

<p>Vanbrugh was a poor man. The whole of the
funds remaining from his scholarships, together with
the remittances doled out grudgingly by his family,
were set aside to pay the rent of the rooms in Brook
Street. His brass-plate, once affixed to the doorpost
there, became his flag, which he would not strike
while life remained. In the meantime he had to
live.</p>

<p>After endless trials in all directions, Bernard Vanbrugh
succeeded in getting employment on the staff
of one of those bureaus which undertake to supply
information on any subject. Vanbrugh&#8217;s was the
medical department, and he was paid at the rate of
half a crown an hour. The work had mostly to be
done at the British Museum, and his weekly earnings
averaged about two pounds.</p>

<p>This, then, was the situation. The most brilliant
follower of medicine in Europe, perhaps the keenest
intellect of his time, was compelled to spend the best
years of his life among broken-down journalists, and
stranded governesses, and all the sad jetsam of the
educated class, doing drudge&#8217;s work for the wages of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
a drudge. The celebrated Huxley had a narrow escape
from the same fate. How many other Huxleys
and Vanbrughs are to-day dreeing the same
weird, while the millions of philanthropy roll about
the gutters, and the billions of endowments pass into
the pockets of the dunce?</p>

<p>Vanbrugh divided his scanty earnings into two
equal portions. Fifty pounds a year paid for his food
and clothes and the rare holidays conceded to health,
with the other fifty he bought books and scientific
instruments.</p>

<p>The subject he had chosen to investigate was the
cells of the brain.</p>

<p>At the age of forty he completed his work on the
brain, and the fifteen years&#8217; penal servitude to which
he had been sentenced by human stupidity and spite
approached its term.</p>

<p>He carried the manuscript to an important publisher,
and solicited a personal interview.</p>

<p>Strange to say, the publisher granted it. Vanbrugh&#8217;s
name was well known to him. Some hints
of his researches had leaked out from time to time,
and the hospitals were already trembling. The meteoric
career of the student had not been forgotten.
Every now and then his brethren spoke of Vanbrugh
as of a man from whom the world was certain to
hear sooner or later. While he was toiling in the
dust he was already reluctantly recognized as the coming
man.</p>

<p>Vanbrugh placed his book in the publisher&#8217;s hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
with something of his old arrogance, which half a
lifetime of hardship had not been able to crush.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a book which will, directly it appears, supersede
every other book on the brain. But if your
reader sees my name on the title-page, he will tell
you it is rubbish. I ask you to submit it to him
without allowing him to know whom it is by, and then
he may tell you the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>The publisher smiled. He glanced from his caller&#8217;s
proud, harsh countenance to his shabby clothes
and patched boots, and thought he could understand.
&#8220;The man is a crank,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;His
troubles have unhinged him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he gave the required promise. He
even went beyond his word. Lest his English reader
should suspect the authorship of the book and be
prejudiced in consequence, he took the trouble to
forward the manuscript to Vienna, to a renowned
specialist in that capital, saying that his usual advisers
differed as to the merit of the work, and requesting
an impartial opinion. This was the first
stroke of fortune in Vanbrugh&#8217;s favour.</p>

<p>In less than a month the publisher was astonished
by receiving back the manuscript with a letter in
which the Viennese authority repeated Vanbrugh&#8217;s
very words.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot understand what you tell me about your
advisers,&#8221; the Austrian wrote. &#8220;This is one of the
greatest works I have ever had the good fortune to
read. It will supersede every existing work on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
brain. The author has done you a high honour in
offering this book to your house.&#8221;</p>

<p>The great publisher winced. It so happened that
he had in the press a voluminous book on this very
subject by a baronet and physician-in-ordinary to the
Court, a book on whose preparation he had already
spent a considerable sum. It was clear that one of
these two books must kill the other. In either case
he must be at a loss. On the other hand, if he were
to refuse Vanbrugh&#8217;s work, it might be taken by the
great rival house which divided the trade with his.</p>

<p>In this uncertainty he decided to submit the manuscript
to his reader in the ordinary way. Scarcely
had he sent it off when he received a second call from
Vanbrugh.</p>

<p>The Austrian specialist, not dreaming that his opinion
could be disregarded, and filled with enthusiasm
for Vanbrugh&#8217;s achievement, had addressed a letter
to him, congratulating him in the warmest terms. The
letter did not elate Vanbrugh in the least, but it
brought him round to the publisher to find out what
was being done with his book.</p>

<p>He came, taking it for granted that its acceptance
was now out of doubt. The publisher, compelled to
give a definite answer, made up his mind on the spot,
and proposed terms which Vanbrugh accepted.</p>

<p>Two days later his reader returned the manuscript
with a brief note, dismissing it as the work of a
charlatan. Vanbrugh had beaten this man in one of
the hospital examinations.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>When the book came out, the medical reviewers
were staggered. They dared not attack, and they
would not praise it; it was therefore allowed to fall
dead from the press. The distinguished baronet,
whose book had been thrown over by the publisher,
was furious. He threatened to have Vanbrugh&#8217;s
name taken off the register as a quack.</p>

<p>The publisher was wringing his hands, when suddenly
an offer arrived from Leipzig for the German
rights of the book, an offer larger in amount than
what he had paid Vanbrugh for the copyright. Similar
offers came tumbling in from Paris, from Rome,
and from St. Petersburg. Rival editions appeared in
New York and Chicago, the publishers of which,
more honest than their legislators, sent considerable
sums to the author. The scientific press on both sides
of the Atlantic rang with the name of Bernard
Vanbrugh, and the popular journals followed suit.</p>

<p>As Vanbrugh had foretold, his book superseded
every existing treatise on the brain.</p>

<p>The first part of the work was a careful and exhaustive
monograph on the brain-cells, their morphology
and physiology. Vanbrugh had applied every
available tool of scientific investigation in his experiments&mdash;chemical
agents, electric discharges, the microscope,
and the photograph. The reaction under
the different rays of the spectrum had been tested separately
and in combination, and results of the highest
interest obtained. But the epoch-making character
of the book was given to it by the second part.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>Here Vanbrugh had boldly essayed the feat of
building a bridge between physiology and what is
called psychology. He had explored what are known
as mental phenomena in the light of his physical
analysis. Into this dim and distrusted region of
knowledge Vanbrugh had projected the searchlight
of his merciless intellect, and had made it scientific
ground.</p>

<p>Even the lay reader could follow him here, and understand
most of his conclusions. Vanbrugh disdained
the hieroglyphic vocabulary of the new priesthood of
science, and forced the words of daily life into the
service. In this part of the book occurred his famous
comparison of the brain to a biograph, with
the process of thought carried on by a series of films,
succeeding each other with inconceivable rapidity, but
yet with a gap of pure annihilation after each.</p>

<p>&#8220;Science is measured knowledge,&#8221; was the keynote
of his triumphant peroration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Science is measured knowledge, and the only
measures we can apply are physical ones, and we can
only apply them to physical phenomena. Slowly but
surely, as we succeed in identifying these processes
called mental with the processes of the brain-cells,
we shall be enabled to reduce them to a plan, to
evolve order out of confusion, and to regulate human
passion and intelligence as we regulate the secretions
of the stomach and the circulation of the blood, the
alternation of the harvests, and the courses of the
tides.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>Such thorough-going materialism shocked and terrified
not a few readers, but the day was gone by for
any objection to be raised on that score in scientific
circles. Before the book had been out a year it was
the recognized authority on the subject with which
it dealt in every civilized country, and the London
colleges were obliged to give it a place upon their
shelves.</p>

<p>Honours and distinctions flowed in upon the author
from abroad. Vienna was the first to offer him
the honorary membership of her first learned society,
and other capitals hastened to do the same. A
great foreign ruler, who considered it a part of his
own greatness to befriend greatness in others, sent
his most coveted Order to the poor English doctor,
of whom his Ambassador in London had never so
much as heard till he was directed to call upon him
with the decoration. Not content with that, the Emperor
wrote privately to the English Court, remonstrating
with it warmly on its neglect of so illustrious
a subject.</p>

<p>The English Court took the hint, and Sir Bernard
Vanbrugh figured in the next list of birthday honours.
Then at last the sullen opposition of the profession
gave way. His brethren realized that they
were compromising their own reputation in the eyes
of the world, and on the next vacancy Vanbrugh
was offered, and he accepted, the Presidency of his
College.</p>

<p>He was now sixty years of age; his appointment-book<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
was filled up for weeks in advance, and his only
child was an heiress.</p>

<p>The Duke of Trent, with all the prestige of his
rank and office, yielded to the same involuntary fear
that Vanbrugh always inspired, and sat down like a
schoolboy in the master&#8217;s presence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we have met very often,&#8221; he began,
&#8220;but I dare say you know that Miss Vanbrugh is a
great friend of my mother&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the mention of his daughter the scientist moved
slightly, and his expression became less severe.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had many opportunities of seeing her at
Colonsay House,&#8221; the Minister pursued, his tone unconsciously
betraying his intimate sense of a favour
about to be conferred, &#8220;and, so far as I am able to
judge, she is disposed to like me. I will come to the
point at once, and say that the object of my visit is
to ask you to give her to me. I don&#8217;t suppose it is
necessary for me to say anything to you on the subject
of my own feelings. I show them sufficiently by
my proposal. I am not a sentimental schoolboy, but
you may believe me when I say that, should your
daughter honour me by becoming my wife, I shall do
the utmost in my power to make her happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Bernard listened without any further sign of
emotion to this speech, the formality of which did
the wooer less harm in his eyes than it might have
done in Hero&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does Hero say?&#8221; was his sole observation
in reply.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>&#8220;I have not spoken to her yet. In fact, I have
never given her any reason to expect this proposal.
We have been friends, and nothing more, so far. I
confess I have felt some difficulty about approaching
her. I have had no experience in love-making, and
it occurred to me that you might be willing to sound
Miss Vanbrugh on my behalf.&#8221;</p>

<p>The physician made no objection to this suggestion.
He remained thinking for some little time, and then
answered deliberately:</p>

<p>&#8220;You have done me an honour, of which I am
entirely sensible, in asking for my daughter&#8217;s hand.
As your wife her position would be a very proud one,
and perhaps most fathers in my place would accept
your offer without a moment&#8217;s hesitation. But Hero
is my only child, and I am a man who has always
held strong views on the question of marriage. I
trust you will not think me wanting in appreciation
of your high claims to consideration if I put exactly
the same questions to you which I have always intended
to put to any man who came to me in the
character of a future son-in-law.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Secretary of State was a little surprised by
this reception of his offer, but on the whole he was
pleased by it. He told himself that few candidates
for matrimony would be better able to withstand a
father&#8217;s scrutiny than he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be very pleased to answer any questions
you wish to put to me. You are most fully entitled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
to know everything I can tell, and I have nothing
to conceal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Bernard Vanbrugh nodded. Opening a drawer
in his desk, he took out a large printed form and
spread it out in front of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had better begin, perhaps,&#8221; the suitor suggested,
&#8220;by giving you the names of my solicitor and banker.
They will give you every information with regard to
my financial circumstances.&#8221;</p>

<p>The physician shook his head slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not doubt that your means are ample, and
my daughter will not be a portionless girl. I am the
medical adviser to a number of insurance companies,
and this paper contains the questions it is my duty
to put to a person who desires to insure his life. In
my view, I ought not to have to say, marriage is an
infinitely more important step than the granting of
a policy. Are you willing for me to examine you
with the same care as if you were asking my employers
to insure you for a few thousand pounds?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke opened his eyes. Not even Sir Bernard
Vanbrugh&#8217;s reputation for originality&mdash;eccentricity it
is called in Government departments&mdash;had prepared
him for such a proposition. But any momentary irritation
was quickly swallowed up in the comforting
reflection: What sort of reception would this man
give to Alistair!</p>

<p>&#8220;I am at your disposal, Sir Bernard!&#8221;</p>

<p>The physician began his methodical examination
exactly as if he were dealing with an ordinary patient.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
He weighed the Cabinet Minister, he measured him,
he took his pulse and temperature, and sounded his
heart and lungs. As test after test was applied the
examiner did not conceal his interest and satisfaction,
and at the close of the ordeal his manner became
almost enthusiastic.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can congratulate you,&#8221; he reported, &#8220;on being
an almost perfect life&mdash;I may say, a remarkable life.
Do you know that you are as nearly as possible a
normal man?&#8221;</p>

<p>The twelfth subject of the Queen looked ever so
slightly disconcerted by the compliment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand, I see,&#8221; said Vanbrugh. &#8220;I
must explain to you that scientific anthropologists
have arrived at certain standards of bodily proportion,
of the energy of the vital functions, and so on,
which they have fixed as constituting the norm of humanity&mdash;that
is to say, the perfect balance which
ought to be found in every member of the species.
The normal man is therefore a scientific abstraction:
he is the imaginary type with which actual individuals
are to be compared, and to which they should as
far as possible conform. Now I find that you fulfil
to an extraordinary degree every requirement which
anthropological science has laid down for the species.
You are, therefore, a normal man&mdash;the first I
have ever been fortunate enough to come across.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke of Trent tried to persuade himself that
this was a flattering report, though in his ear the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
word &#8220;normal&#8221; sounded disagreeably like commonplace.</p>

<p>&#8220;At all events, you are satisfied?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am more than satisfied so far. Now as to your
family history&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first time a misgiving stole into the Duke&#8217;s
mind, as he remembered Lord Alexander Stuart&#8217;s
career. Surely this scientific inquisitor was not going
to visit the sins of the father on the son, as his words
foreboded?</p>

<p>&#8220;Is your father living?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I have the title,&#8221; the Duke reminded him.</p>

<p>&#8220;True. At what age did he die?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As far as I can recollect, at about thirty-eight or
forty. I could easily ascertain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may not be necessary. What did he die of?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke&#8217;s cheeks burned. But he saw the folly
of temporizing with a man like Vanbrugh. The
story of Lord Alexander was perfectly well known
in London.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of <i>delirium tremens</i>, I am afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Bernard&#8217;s eyebrows lifted, and he shot a painful
glance at the unfortunate son.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mother,&#8221; he hastened to say, &#8220;I know is
alive. What is her state of health?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke was glad to be able to reply altogether
satisfactorily. He was beginning to breathe again
when the scientist put the fatal question:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any brothers or sisters?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One brother.&#8221; As the admission escaped him all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
his old bitterness against his junior returned with ten-fold
force.</p>

<p>&#8220;Living?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he is living.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely I have heard something about him lately?&#8221;
Sir Bernard said reflectively. &#8220;What is he called?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Alistair Stuart.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words might have been red-hot coals on the
Duke&#8217;s lips and not have given him a greater wrench
to utter.</p>

<p>Sir Bernard Vanbrugh laid down his paper and
leant back in his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot congratulate you on your family history,&#8221;
he said gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely, sir, you will not hold me responsible because
I had an unworthy father, and have a brother
who takes after him? I am not like them. Ask anyone
who has ever known me, and they will tell you
that my life has been absolutely free from reproach.
I neither drink nor gamble; I have never indulged in
any kind of vice&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The physician interrupted him with a quiet gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not a priest, Duke, but a scientist. I am
not here to deal in moral blame or praise, but to decide
whether you are a man whom I can welcome as
the father of my grandchildren. Your family history
is against you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every family has its black sheep,&#8221; the unfortunate
suitor urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every existing family is the result of ill-assorted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
marriages, brought about by any consideration rather
than the desire to have healthy offspring. You must
forgive my saying that Lord Alistair Stuart is a very
black sheep indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alistair is not hopeless,&#8221; said the Duke, astonished
to find himself defending his brother. &#8220;He is
young yet, and he may settle down and marry some
respectable woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven forbid!&#8221; Sir Bernard Vanbrugh noted
his listener&#8217;s bewilderment at this unexpected rejoinder.
&#8220;The greatest service a man like your brother
can render to society is to lead the life he is leading.
Nature understands these things better than we do.
She takes a man like that and unites him with a
woman like Molly Finucane in order that the vicious
strain may die out. To take your brother away and
marry him to a healthy woman, in order that they
might have diseased children, would be the worst of
crimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>James Stuart shuddered as he listened to the voice
of the new morality preaching its relentless gospel.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you didn&#8217;t find any strain of disease in me?&#8221;
he pleaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;These things often pass over a generation. The
law of heredity is still mysterious. It is the most
important of all the problems awaiting scientific solution.
You ask me to take a risk&mdash;a tremendous risk.
I can only promise to consider it carefully.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of his own accord Sir Bernard added:</p>

<p>&#8220;As far as you are personally concerned, I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
not hope to meet a man to whom I should give my
daughter with greater confidence. Your temperament
is exactly what she needs to correct her own
tendency to emotionalism. You see, I am frank with
you, Duke, as frank as you have been with me. I
have watched over my daughter with all the powers
of observation I possess from her earliest years, and
I cannot shut my eyes to her weakness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Vanbrugh is as near perfection as any girl
I have seen!&#8221; exclaimed the wooer, with unwonted
enthusiasm. &#8220;If she has a weakness it is in being
too ready to sacrifice herself for others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the weakness I mean,&#8221; the scientist resumed
calmly. &#8220;Her attraction towards Catholicism
has given me some anxiety, and would give me more
if I thought it went below the surface.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are not a Protestant?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Bernard Vanbrugh smiled at the old-fashioned
word.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are no more Protestants,&#8221; he pronounced.
&#8220;There is Science and there is Superstition. Religion,
as I understand it, is a form of hysteria, skilfully exploited
in the interests of the clerical class. To me
as a physician this Catholic revival is the symptom
of a widespread cerebral disease which attacks individuals
of morbid temperament. I have watched the
class of persons who exhibit the symptom, and I have
seldom failed to trace the disease. On the whole I
am inclined to diagnose it as an obscure form of sexual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
perversion. A woman does not want to go to confession
unless she has something to confess.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Home Secretary shivered, as he listened to this
brutal analysis, with the same sense of discomfort as
a thinly-clad man exposed to a cold blast of air. He
was not the first man who had experienced the same
sensation in listening to Bernard Vanbrugh.</p>

<p>A week later he received the scientist&#8217;s decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;It gives me great pain,&#8221; Sir Bernard wrote, &#8220;not
to be able to accept your proposal for my daughter&#8217;s
hand, but your family history is too bad. Personally,
you are everything that a father could desire,
but my grandchildren must not have in their veins
the same blood as Lord Alistair Stuart.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>THE PRETENDER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> mood of deep dissatisfaction with his life
which had been growing upon Alistair Stuart of late
was strongly with him as he left the Underground
Railway-station at Westminster, and walked across
the bridge on his way to see Des Louvres.</p>

<p>The night was misty, but not dark, the lamps were
lit, and the Palace showed up grey and spectral beside
the water, while farther on there stretched a dim
line of river-shore unillumined by any spark of light,
as though night and slumber had overcome and blotted
out that quarter of the city, while the other parts
were still awake with feverish life.</p>

<p>As Alistair reached the southern foot of the bridge
all the lights and sounds of Lambeth burst upon him
with an effect of squalid but stirring energy.</p>

<p>He plunged into the bustling thoroughfare, with
its noisy street-stalls, its jostling tramcars, and its
hurrying passengers, as a bather plunges into the sea,
and took his way along the road which branches southwards
in the direction of Kennington. The sense of
bankruptcy and failure no longer affected him disagreeably
as it still did in the region he had just quitted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
Here his poverty seemed to bring him into touch
with the life about him, and he looked at everything
with pleased, expectant eyes, like a traveller wandering
through the picturesque slums of some romantic
town of Spain or Italy in which he thinks of settling
for a time.</p>

<p>He drew a deep breath of anticipation, like a man
about to be released from prison, as he reflected that
the poverty which he had been afraid of might become
a glorious incognito, under which his nature
would have freer play than it had ever had in the
world which had held him hitherto. The thought of
this new, strange freedom caused his blood to tingle.
Strange, formless instincts and yearnings began to
stir within him. He glanced curiously to right and
left as he walked along, down dark, narrow turnings
with narrower courts and alleys leading out of them,
and the impulse grew upon him to throw off the ways
and hampering conventions of his class, and mingle
in the mysterious, half-naked life of this underground
world of which he seemed to catch glimpses all
around him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are adventures to be met with here!&#8221; he
whispered to himself. &#8220;There are men who commit
crimes!&#8221;</p>

<p>All the old lawless blood of a hundred generations
of highland manslayers and freebooters surged up
into his brain, and he fidgeted in his civilized bonds
as a boy on a hot summer&#8217;s day fidgets in his clothes
before the splash and sparkle of the sea.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>For a moment he stopped in front of a house which
was to let, but a glance at his watch caused him to
move on at a quickened pace. He was amused with
the idea that the watch, which he had bought in Paris,
would pay for a year&#8217;s rent of the house.</p>

<p>By this time the character of the thoroughfare had
begun to change. He was passing by terraces of lodging-houses
standing back behind long narrow strips
that had once been gardens. In some of them the
sickly grass still struggled for existence, in others it
had frankly given up the ghost and been replaced by
gravel. Decayed notice-boards behind the railings announced
the various ways in which the tenants of these
houses struggled for a livelihood; one aspired to be
a coal-merchant, one deemed himself a dentist, others
would have liked to give lessons in shorthand or
book-keeping; none of them, it was to be feared, got
much beyond the stage of expectation.</p>

<p>Presently Stuart came to a street in which the
houses seemed to be of a better class; it was a street
which still preserved some features from the time
when this neighbourhood had ranked as a residential
suburb for the prosperous middle class, on a level with
Dulwich or Finchley of to-day. The name painted
on the side-wall was Chestnut-Tree Walk, and the
first house in the street was detached, and surrounded
by a high wall, over which a few straggling shoots of
dirty ivy hung their heads, while at the side of the
house rose up one or two trees which, if the thick
black crust upon their limbs and stunted foliage could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
have been washed off, might have proved even to be
chestnuts.</p>

<p>This house was the end of Alistair&#8217;s walk. It was
the residence of the Comte des Louvres.</p>

<p>The situation was happily chosen for privacy. The
neighbourhood was not quite poor enough for a well-dressed
man to be conspicuous, and not quite respectable
enough to possess an organized social vehmgericht,
while it was altogether off the track of the
ordinary foreign outlaw. Such of his neighbours as
had noticed his existence at all supposed the tenant
of Chestnut-Tree House, known simply as &#8220;Monsieur,&#8221;
to be a teacher of the French language, who
had seen better days. The last supposition was not
very wide of the mark, but the better days were those
of the Count&#8217;s ancestors, real and fictitious. His
great-grandfather, a wealthy furniture-maker, had
conferred the title on himself in the confusion of the
great Revolution, after the last of the true Des Louvres
had perished by the guillotine. Similar occupations
of vacant honours were too common at the time
for this one to attract much attention, and the furniture-maker&#8217;s
son, by a great display of zeal for the
Bourbons and for Holy Church, had succeeded in
firmly establishing his position in the aristocratic
sphere. It was the grandson who had dissipated the
family fortune, leaving the present Count only the
inheritance of a good name.</p>

<p>The merits of his ancestors, or his own Legitimist
zeal, had secured for Des Louvres the patronage of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
the Pretender who passed as the Comte de Rouen,
but whom the Count invariably referred to in private
as His Most Christian Majesty Louis XIX. In the
service of this personage Des Louvres filled a position
half-way between that of a press-agent and a charg&eacute;
d&#8217;affaires, supplying the English newspapers with
paragraphs in the Count&#8217;s interest, and generally
watching the course of events on his behalf.</p>

<p>Des Louvres had made no mystery of these functions,
but a certain obscurity hung over whatever other
transactions he was engaged in. Some persons believed
him to be in the employment of a Government
celebrated for its elaborate secret police organized in
every capital of the world; others suspected the Count
of rendering services even less creditable to a certain
foreign potentate, and hinted that the house in Chestnut-Tree
Walk, if it could speak, would be able to
tell some very strange stories indeed.</p>

<p>Among these activities of Des Louvres which he
took less pains to hide was his connection with the
English Legitimists. It was he who kept them in
touch with the more important organizations abroad&mdash;in
France, in Spain, in Italy, and in Portugal. He
cheered their flagging spirits, oppressed by the sense
of their insignificance at home, by making them feel
that the Guild was taken seriously on the Continent,
and that they themselves were persons of note in
Paris and Madrid. It brought consolation and refreshment
to Egerton and Wickham Vane to know
that their toy conspiracy bulked largely in the columns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
of such trusted organs of the Papacy as the
<i>Osservatore Romano</i> or the <i>Paris Univers</i>.</p>

<p>Des Louvres was one of those who know human
nature only by its weaknesses. Such men seldom come
to grief, though they never come to greatness. He
had been the first to perceive that Lord Alistair Stuart&#8217;s
bankruptcy would change his point of view in
certain respects, and to lay his plans accordingly.</p>

<p>As soon as Stuart touched the bell-knob of Chestnut-Tree
House&mdash;the door abstained from the indiscretion
of a knocker&mdash;he was admitted by the
Count&#8217;s confidential servant, a fellow whom it did
not require the science of M. Bertillon to identify
as a hardened criminal. Leclerc, as this respectable
felon was called, received Lord Alistair with an exaggeration
of his customary deference, and ushered
him towards what Des Louvres called his cabinet.</p>

<p>On the way he observed respectfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;You will find Monsieur le Comte alone. His
Royal Highness has not yet arrived.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke in a sort of church whisper, as though
the coming princeling already cast a shadow of awe
before.</p>

<p>Des Louvres came out to receive his visitor, whom
he greeted with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am delighted you have managed to get here.
Don Juan is most anxious to make your acquaintance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stuart had come to keep the appointment with a
certain feeling of interest in the romance of Don<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
Juan&#8217;s exalted claims, tempered with an insular distrust
of foreign royalties and foreign decorations.
His prejudice softened insensibly under the Count&#8217;s
blandishments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has his father much of a party left?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly a very strong one. The priesthood
has never taken kindly to the constitutional dynasty,
and you know that in those countries the Church is
still a power.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose there is no prospect of his taking the
field?&#8221; Stuart said wistfully, as he thought of what
a glorious escape it would be from the ruins of his
present life to take part in a romantic expedition to
a sunburnt land, to recover a lost crown.</p>

<p>The watchful Frenchman caught the note of yearning
in Alistair&#8217;s voice, and his answer was tuned in
sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, there is every prospect just now.
Not the father himself, of course&mdash;he is too old&mdash;but
Don Juan as his representative. His father intends
to abdicate in his favour, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you think he has a real chance?&#8221; asked Alistair.
His eyes lit up as he pictured himself lying
out on the wild sierras, making the camp-fire under
the cork-trees at night, and in the daytime taking part
in that great game whose stakes are death and renown.
Already he was marching, crowned with myrtle,
through Gothic cities bedight in flags and flowers,
his ears deafened with the clang of joy bells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
and the roar of exultant throngs, and his veins throbbing
with the intoxication of victory.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I did not think so I should not have asked you
to meet him,&#8221; answered Des Louvres, following up
the impression he had made. &#8220;The Prince has come
to England in order to organize an expedition. All
he requires are the necessary funds to arm his followers
with modern weapons. As soon as he succeeds
in landing the first shipload of magazine rifles
and ammunition the country will be in flames&mdash;I
ought to say that I mention this for your ear alone.
You are the only person in England beside myself
whom the Prince is willing to take into his confidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair received this compliment with satisfaction
not unmixed with surprise. Hitherto he had not
been very serious in his support of the Legitimist
cause, for Alistair was one of those who are wiser
in judgment than in action, and it did not escape
him that a party which rallied to it such adherents
as the two Vanes contained no very formidable menace
for existing institutions. To find himself thus
singled out as the one English partisan whom Don
Juan considered worthy of his confidence was therefore
as unexpected as it was gratifying.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Don Juan would care to have me, I should
like to volunteer for the expedition,&#8221; he said eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that you could not please him more than
by such an offer,&#8221; Des Louvres responded. &#8220;He will
certainly invite you to serve as one of his aides-de-camp.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
This will make it especially appropriate for
him to give you the Holy Sepulchre.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair could not resist a slight grimace. He was
unable to overcome the fear that by his acceptance
of this doubtful honour he might be making himself
ridiculous. He had recently been forced to contrast
himself rather sharply with his elder brother; the
contrast would be sharp indeed between the Garter
which Trent expected soon to receive and this mock
badge bestowed by a foreign adventurer.</p>

<p>Des Louvres was aware of Stuart&#8217;s feeling, which
he had man&#339;uvred skilfully to overcome.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, the Prince recognizes that in the present
state of his affairs it is you who confer a favour
on him by consenting to take this decoration,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You must not suppose that he does not understand
the difference between you and a man like Egerton
Vane.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t think you would have much difficulty
in persuading either of the Vanes to accept the Order
of the Holy Sepulchre.&#8221;</p>

<p>Des Louvres shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have promised them the second or third class,
as a matter of fact. They are gentlemen, and it will
make a good impression abroad if the Prince appears
to have a strong connection in England.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had scarcely finished his explanation when the
faithful Leclerc opened the door to admit the two
brothers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>As Stuart had judged, Des Louvres had encountered
no misgiving on their part. At the first mention
of the Pretender and his decoration their flushed
cheeks and sparkling eyes had betrayed the eagerness
within. In fact, their feelings had been so unmistakable
that Don Juan&#8217;s agent thought he might
safely slip in an intimation that there were fees in
connection with the Order of the Holy Sepulchre,
as in the case of better known and more highly coveted
distinctions. The fees payable by a Chevalier,
he informed Egerton, amounted to sixty pounds in
English money, while Wickham might compound for
the lower dignity of a Companion with forty pounds.
This disagreeable preliminary had caused much anguish
to the brothers, who were both misers at heart;
but after a severe struggle vanity triumphed over avarice,
and they handed their cheques to the Count as
Chancellor of the Order, on his assurance that the
sums named represented little more than the actual
cost of the jewels they would receive from His Royal
Highness.</p>

<p>The sight of Lord Alistair Stuart in the Count&#8217;s
study came as a considerable shock to the Vanes, who
had looked forward to patronizing Stuart on the
strength of their new honour. &#8220;In foreign Courts
they attach more importance to a decoration than
to a mere courtesy title,&#8221; Egerton had already laid
it down to his admiring brother. &#8220;I am not sure
that, as a Chevalier of the Holy Sepulchre, I am not
entitled to take precedence of Alistair Stuart.&#8221; The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
study of ancient tapestry not throwing any light on
this important problem, Wickham received the observation
with that soothing docility which his brother
had been accustomed to exact from their nursery days.</p>

<p>But a bitterer stroke awaited the Chevalier Vane,
as Egerton had now instructed his servants to call
him. For scarcely had the new-comers exchanged
greetings with the rival they found before them when
a confident ring at the front-door was followed by the
entrance of the one man whom they had most wished
to crush with their newly-acquired rank&mdash;in short,
Mr. St. Maur.</p>

<p>Neither of the Vanes could conceal his chagrin at
this turn of affairs, and Des Louvres perceived that
all his tact would be required to smooth them down.
As soon as the intruder had planted himself, with
his customary simple strategy, beside Lord Alistair
as the person of highest rank present, their host put
his lips to the ear of the Chevalier.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a thousand pities that we have no better
Irishman among us than this fellow,&#8221; he whispered.
&#8220;His Royal Highness insisted on my presenting some
representative of Ireland to him; and what could
I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you should have declined,&#8221; the Chevalier
Vane returned acidly. &#8220;I consider that the dignity
of the Order will be lowered if the Prince bestows
it on a man like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His family is very ancient and illustrious,&#8221; Des
Louvres suggested.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>The Chevalier Vane put on a pitying smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid his family doesn&#8217;t much appreciate
the connection. I have never heard of St. Maur&#8217;s
being asked to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He named the ducal seat to
which St. Maur was in the habit of referring as if it
had been his childhood&#8217;s home.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a foreigner; I do not understand these
things,&#8221; said the Frenchman. &#8220;But I have met this
man in your flat, and I have heard you introduce him
to others as a relative of the Duke&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>The charge was a true one, and Egerton winced.
The Count pursued pitilessly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides, it is a very common thing in this country,
is it not, for the elder branch to ignore the existence
of the younger ones?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was hitting Vane on a raw place. The abiding
sorrow of the brothers&#8217; lives was that their titled
relative, a vulgar Philistine immersed in field-sports
and such coarse pleasures, had never taken the slightest
notice of a cousinship which should have been
his pride.</p>

<p>Further discussion was prevented by the sound of
wheels outside. Des Louvres instantly excused himself
to his guests, and went out to the front-door to
receive his royal guest with fitting honour.</p>

<p>The personage who now alighted from a hansom-cab,
and walked up the steps to where the Count
stood waiting with bowed head, was a tall, swarthy
young man of a rather heavy type of face, and sombre
eyes. The face and figure were not lacking in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
distinction, though they could scarcely be called handsome.
Their chief defect, however, was an air of
listlessness and lifelessness, as though the unfortunate
bearer of a great name had been crushed beneath
its weight from his birth.</p>

<p>Life had, in fact, had nothing to offer Don Juan
that he could accept as compensation for what his
forefathers had possessed and lost. The misery of
opposition, the misery of exile, and the misery of ruin
had accumulated their shadows over his cradle. The
secret of earthly happiness is to have found the work
we are best fitted for, and to be doing it with all our
might. The only work for which this young man
had been formed by birth or circumstance was to
saunter in black velvet beneath the shade of cedar-trees,
in a park wide as a province, with a falcon on
his wrist, and silk-clad favourites on each side of him,
while behind a curtain a queen and a confessor played
chess for his kingdom. It was thus that his ancestors
had discharged their office for two centuries; it
was thus that he himself would have discharged it had
the kingdom been still to lose.</p>

<p>It is unhappiness to gaze too long at the unattainable.
The memory of the past had been to Don
Juan what a glimpse of London is sometimes to a
savage, unfitting him to take up his daily task, and
rendering his life a dull ache of longings for the
remote and unachieved. In understudying the great
part he was never likely to play he had missed the
chance of success in some humbler r&ocirc;le.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>The poor Royal Highness mounted the steps of
Chestnut-Tree House and greeted Des Louvres in a
tone of intimacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not too soon, am I? Those gentlemen have
come?&#8221; he asked, using the French language.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are awaiting you, sir,&#8221; the Count returned
with a nice mixture of cordiality and deference.
&#8220;Leclerc, marshal His Royal Highness to the audience-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leclerc, looking more like a gaolbird than ever,
led the way upstairs, while his master walked respectfully
in the visitor&#8217;s rear. They entered a large
drawing-room in which the furniture had been disposed
with some care, so that an armchair stood by
itself against one wall in the manner of a throne.</p>

<p>&#8220;This chair is for you, sir,&#8221; the Count said persuasively,
as the Pretender stood hesitating. &#8220;If I
may venture to advise, it will be better to rise to receive
Lord Alistair Stuart, as he is the heir to a dukedom.
The others are simply gentlemen, and you
may receive them seated. It will do good to maintain
a little reserve with them, but of course that does
not apply to Lord Alistair, who is, or has been, intimate
with the Royal Family in this country. In his
case I have ventured to waive the question of fees.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don Juan&#8217;s face fell slightly at this last intimation,
the exchequer of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre
being a not unimportant item in the princely civil
list.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never given the Order to any one for nothing,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
he objected. &#8220;The price of the Grand Cordon
is two thousand francs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Des Louvres put on his most conciliating air.</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember, sir, that you are going to ask Lord
Alistair to render you an important service. It is
well to establish a claim on him beforehand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still, Des Louvres, I think he should pay something.
As a favour I am willing to let him have the
collar for a thousand francs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid in that case he would decline it. I
must tell Your Royal Highness frankly that there
is a very strong prejudice amongst the British nobility
against foreign decorations, no matter of what
kind. I had almost to urge Lord Alistair to accept
your Order.&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor Pretender winced at this plain speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust, Count, you have not degraded my family
Order,&#8221; he said, with a flash of pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, Prince, I have given it prestige
in British eyes. Lord Alistair Stuart belongs to the
highest nobility; his brother is Minister of the Interior.
Permit me to assure you that the moment it
becomes known that he has accepted the Order of
the Holy Sepulchre its value will be greatly increased.
You will be able to sell as many of the second and
third classes as you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, if you tell me that&#8221;&mdash;muttered the disappointed
Prince.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I do tell you,&#8221; Des Louvres returned, with
some impatience. He was used to dealing with these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
waifs and strays of royalty, and their airs and pretensions
frequently tried his temper. &#8220;You have
brought the jewels with you, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>Don Juan fished in his pockets, and brought out
four small boxes covered with imitation leather, and
lined with cheap plush.</p>

<p>The boxes on being opened revealed small badges
in different metals&mdash;gold, silver, and bronze&mdash;in the
form of a cross enamelled with a Latin motto. The
one intended for Lord Alistair was attached to a
neck-ribbon, and the intrinsic value of the four together
might have been about five pounds.</p>

<p>As soon as Des Louvres had arranged these gimcracks
on a small table beside the Prince he withdrew
to summon the four candidates. On the way he
passed into his dressing-room, and selected his own
collar and badge from a number of other decorations
more or less real.</p>

<p>Entering the room where the others were waiting,
he drew a paper from his pocket, from which he
read aloud with perfect gravity, for though Des Louvres
was a rascal he was a Frenchman, and perhaps
took the proceedings more seriously than any of his
English puppets.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the protocol approved by His Royal Highness,&#8221;
he explained. &#8220;We shall enter the room in
the following order: myself, as Chancellor; Lord
Alistair Stuart; Mr. Vane; Mr. St. Maur; and Mr.
Wickham Vane. I shall present you in the same order,
and as I pronounce each name you will advance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
bowing low, and kiss the Prince&#8217;s hand. As soon
as the presentations are finished I shall recall you to
receive your decorations. Each of you will then advance
in turn, and go down on one knee, the Prince
rising. His Royal Highness will throw the Collar
of the Order over Lord Alistair&#8217;s neck, and kiss him
on one cheek; he will fasten the Chevalier&#8217;s badge on
Mr. Vane&#8217;s breast, and hand the Companion&#8217;s badges
to the other two.&#8221;</p>

<p>No one raising any objections to the ceremonial
indicated, the Count led the way upstairs, where his
man was waiting to throw open the door.</p>

<p>As Stuart approached him, bearing himself with
the dignity of one who was himself a descendant of
kings, Don Juan rose instinctively, and, departing
from the protocol, courteously shook hands. He sat
down again to receive the other three in the manner
prescribed. The Vanes showed their superior acquaintance
with Court etiquette by merely approaching
their lips to the royal hand; the Irishman&#8217;s smack
betrayed the warmth of his nation.</p>

<p>The bestowal of the decorations followed, causing
a disagreeable surprise to the two brothers as they
perceived the difference between the value of their
jewels as bullion and the substantial sums they had
paid for them.</p>

<p>The formalities happily accomplished, Don Juan,
who had played his part with a mixture of pride and
uneasiness, at once put aside his state, and invited the
company to treat him as a friend.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>St. Maur instantly clutched the chair nearest to
the Prince&#8217;s, and drew it forward, cleverly cutting
off the new-made Chevalier, while Des Louvres rang
the bell for champagne and cigars.</p>

<p>The Pretender at once began to talk about the
prospects of his cause, not saying anything directly
about the proposed expedition, but giving his listeners
to understand that he hoped before very long to receive
them more suitably in the palace of his ancestors.</p>

<p>The Prince&#8217;s French being rather too fluent for
some of his British hearers, and theirs not quite fluent
enough, Des Louvres helped out the conversation
with hints and explanations of his own, now throwing
in a respectful question, and now reminding Don
Juan of some point he had passed over.</p>

<p>Alistair had suffered from a sense of awkwardness
during the previous ritual, and he still felt half
ashamed whenever he glanced at the gaudy ribbon
on his shoulders. But as the conversation went forward
his reserve melted away, his eyes began to
sparkle, and he questioned the Pretender, as eagerly
as good manners allowed, on the state of the country
and the chances of a campaign.</p>

<p>Don Juan noticed the interest he had aroused, and
his tone towards Lord Alistair Stuart became evidently
more friendly, while the Chevalier Vane as evidently
bored him by disquisitions on the art and literature
of the promised land.</p>

<p>Finally, after throwing a look at Des Louvres, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
receiving an imperceptible nod in return, the Prince
rose to his feet, saying, as he did so:</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall hope to receive you again before long,
gentlemen. Will you remain behind a few minutes,
Milord Stuart? I have something to ask you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The others were obliged to take their leave, the
Chevalier remarking with some bitterness to his
brother on their way home that even royalty in these
days is tainted with the Philistinism of the triumphant
middle class.</p>

<p>Another bottle of champagne was opened, and as
soon as Stuart had emptied his glass, Des Louvres
approached the real object of the conference.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prince wants to buy arms for his partisans,
as I told you, and he is over here in order to raise
the money. I have taken the liberty of saying that I
think you may be willing to assist him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I!&#8221; exclaimed the astonished Alistair.</p>

<p>The Frenchman bent forward, and murmured
softly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I ventured to tell His Royal Highness that you
were on intimate terms with the head of the South
American Bank.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mendes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. The suggestion is that you should sound
Mendes on the Prince&#8217;s behalf.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair sat as one dumbfounded, and for some
moments the other two watched him without speaking a word.</p>

<p>A repugnance, which he could hardly explain to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
himself, battled within him against yielding to the
Pretender&#8217;s request. Mendes was his intimate acquaintance;
Mendes sat at his table, and entertained
him in return. He was a banker; it was his business
to grant loans, and this was a loan for an object which
Alistair heartily sympathized with. And yet he felt
he would have gone to anyone rather than Mendes.</p>

<p>Des Louvres understood the silent struggle better,
perhaps, than Alistair himself. He also knew the
way to end it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not taking any champagne,&#8221; said the
tempter, refilling his glass for him.</p>

<p>Mechanically, weakly, Alistair lifted the glass to
his lips, and drained it. As he set it down again a
flush overspread his face, and he cried out thickly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? I&#8217;ll tackle old Mendes with pleasure.
He&#8217;s not a bad sort; he would like to oblige me, I
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>An hour later the Frenchman and his servant were
helping Lord Alistair Stuart into a cab, to the driver
of which the Count gave the necessary directions,
while the sober Prince looked on with a face of regretful
dismay.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<small>THE POWERS THAT BE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Alistair woke up on the morning after his
promise to Don Juan, he did not feel happy.</p>

<p>Apart from the headache left by his overnight excess,
he suffered from the recollection of the pledge
extorted from him. He owed nothing whatever to
Mendes, and yet it put a strain upon his sense of
honour to ask a favour of the Brazilian.</p>

<p>Mendes and he had been friendly for a long time,
without being friends. Their acquaintance had begun
and continued, so to speak, along two parallel
lines. Molly Finucane had brought them together.
And Molly Finucane kept them apart.</p>

<p>Molly had known the financier longer than she had
known Alistair Stuart. When she gave way to that
touch of real sentiment which united her to Stuart,
Mendes had shown no resentment and made no unpleasant
scenes. Perhaps it was partly for that reason,
out of a kind of mild remorse, that Molly had
continued to receive him as a friend, and even to encourage
his visits; although with the new sense of
honour which had been developed in her by her passion
for Stuart, the little woman steadily refused to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
accept the smallest gift from the millionaire. Perhaps,
also, she saw that the presence of Mendes, seated
at their dinner-table day after day, bland, reserved,
and calmly expectant, like a player whose turn to
play has not yet come, acted as a talisman on Alistair,
who was made to see that another was waiting to
snatch the prize from him if he once loosened his
grasp.</p>

<p>It was noon by the time Alistair got down to the
breakfast-table, and he sat picking at some tough,
half-cold kidneys, and grumbling to Molly, who was
in a dressing-gown pouring out his coffee.</p>

<p>&#8220;These things are not fit to eat,&#8221; he complained
crossly, pushing away his plate.</p>

<p>Molly reminded him that the cook was under notice
to leave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our servants generally are,&#8221; he retorted. &#8220;But
we don&#8217;t seem to get any better ones in their place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I am a bad housekeeper,&#8221; was the meek
response. Complaints of this kind on Alistair&#8217;s part
were a new symptom, and Molly was frightened by
it. &#8220;Good servants expect such high wages nowadays,&#8221;
she added.</p>

<p>&#8220;They expect their wages to be paid regularly, you
mean. No wonder they won&#8217;t do their work properly
when they don&#8217;t get paid for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have no money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair coloured up as he was again recalled to his
position.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t get any now, at all events,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose Trent will be such a cad as
to stop my allowance, but the next cheque won&#8217;t be
due till Christmas, and we can&#8217;t very well borrow
any more. What about Carter&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>Carter&#8217;s was the establishment from which they
were accustomed to get their household supplies, one
of those huge bazaars which deal in everything from
a landed estate to a packet of pins.</p>

<p>&#8220;I paid them a hundred pounds the other day,&#8221;
Molly answered. &#8220;I expect they&#8217;ll give us credit for
a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair said nothing, but sat tapping the table with
his fork, and thinking.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must sell some of my jewels, I suppose,&#8221; said
Molly bravely, after a short silence.</p>

<p>Alistair looked up and studied her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not sell the furniture and everything, and
let&#8217;s clear out of this place? We can&#8217;t go on like
this much longer, any way. What should you say to
disappearing for a time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221; asked Molly, startled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somewhere over on the south side. I thought of
Lambeth. If we&#8217;re going to be poor, it&#8217;s best to live
where everybody else is poor around us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Molly stared at him in consternation. In her ears
the proposal, if it were serious, sounded like the end
of everything. Molly had been born and bred in
Lambeth. She knew what life there was. The idea
of returning to it, after her experience of luxury,
struck her as a dismal form of suicide. And not being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
able to divine the curious, half-romantic attraction
which the scheme had come to possess for Alistair,
she credited him with her own feeling of repulsion.
The suspicion quickly followed that this suggestion
covered a design to give her up. Stuart meant
to demonstrate that it was impossible for them to live
together any longer, and on that pretext to accept the
offers of his family to rescue him.</p>

<p>The spectre of parting, never really laid, always
peeping out at odd moments to grin at her, now
showed its haunting features plainly, and she cried
out with passion:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! Don&#8217;t talk like that! Don&#8217;t talk like
that, Alistair!&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair shrugged his shoulders as he rose from
the table. He had not expected his proposition to be
very eagerly welcomed at first, and he was content
to let the idea rest in her mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got to go into the City this morning,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>Molly glanced at him inquiringly, but thought it
wiser not to ask whom he was going to see.</p>

<p>He took a third-class ticket on the Underground
Railway, in accordance with his resolution to experiment
with poverty. But he had donned a frock-coat
from Savile Row in order to give his mission a serious
character, and he noticed that this incongruous
dress seemed to be a cause of offence to his fellow-passengers.
Two workmen with a roll of leaden piping,
whom he found in his compartment, stared at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
him with resentful scorn, and made remarks to one
another in an undertone which he could see were
disparaging.</p>

<p>Alistair had to discover that to be the outcast of
the aristocracy does not of itself constitute one a
member of the democracy. To acquire a low position
in life something more is necessary than to have
lost a high one.</p>

<p>He got out at the Mansion House Station, and
made his way towards the great whirlpool of traffic
formed by the eight streets which debouch in front
of the Royal Exchange.</p>

<p>Here he could not resist the inclination to stand
still for a minute on one of the small islets of pavement
which divide the stream. He told himself that
this was the centre of the world&#8217;s business, the heart
of that vast invisible machine which steadily converts
the labour of fifteen hundred millions of men into
the wealth of a prosperous few. The low brown
building, blackened with London grime, which faced
him with such solid immovability, needed no letters
on its front to tell that it was the Bank of England.
It was here, surely, and not in that pretentious palace
further west beside the river, that the true centre
of gravity resided; this really was the core of that
political and social system with whose genius his genius
was at war; it was for the men whom that brown
square of building sheltered, and not for anyone else,
that the legislators travailed, and the police went their
daily rounds, as the soldiers fought on far-off continents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
and the sailors adventured in uncharted seas.
In the interest of wealth it was, in the last analysis,
that the Raj had been built up, that the firm framework
of society had been compacted, and that such
outlaws as himself were held in check. Not Yahveh,
and not Christ, neither Ormuzd nor Ahriman, but
Mammon was the God of the Anglo-Roman Raj&mdash;Mammon,
whom that Syrian Redeemer had so much
hated; Mammon, who had built all the churches ever
since unto this day.</p>

<p>Alistair&#8217;s head drooped on his breast as he moved
slowly on. He found himself presently in a narrow
turning off Lombard Street, a sunless retreat giving
no outward indication that the great spiders of finance
set their webs within.</p>

<p>It was the quarter of bankers&#8217; bankers. A clerk
from the head office of some limited company with
branches in half the towns of England would walk
in quickly through a swing-door, pass through an
outer office without stopping, and approach a long
table at which two or three men were seated side by
side. A name would be mentioned, a bundle of bills
exhibited, and some figure pronounced. The two or
three heads would turn and exchange glances; one
would give a nod across the table, and the clerk would
walk out again. The nod had meant the loan of a
million for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>It was the first time that Alistair had visited Mendes
in his business quarters, and it took him a minute
or two to discover the brass-plate which bore the name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
of the South American Bank. Even then he had to
grope his way through what seemed to him a maze
of stairs and passages before he reached a small
wired counter, protecting a pale clerk who asked him
his business.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have called to see Mr. Mendes.&#8221;</p>

<p>He handed in his card with a patronage of which
he was quite unconscious. The clerk received it respectfully
enough, and passed out of sight round a
partition. A minute then elapsed before a man in
sober livery came out from a side-door and asked his
lordship to be good enough to follow him.</p>

<p>He showed Lord Alistair into a small, comfortably-furnished
room, in which a man of forty or thereabouts,
well dressed and fully self-possessed, was seated
at a writing-table.</p>

<p>He rose politely as Alistair entered, and offered
him a chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Mendes has someone with him at the moment,&#8221;
he said, speaking courteously, but without any
particular deference. &#8220;Perhaps it may save time if
you can tell me what you wish to see him about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a personal friend of Mr. Mendes,&#8221; returned
Stuart haughtily.</p>

<p>The other did not seem to feel rebuked.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you have not called on business it might be
better for you to go to his private house,&#8221; he said
quietly. &#8220;Mr. Mendes is a very busy man, and it is
against his rule to receive his private friends here,
except by appointment.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>The last words seemed to be underlined with meaning.
Was it possible that this courteous intermediary
was already aware that Lord Alistair had no appointment,
and was taking it on himself to refuse him
an interview with the principal?</p>

<p>&#8220;I have business of an important character with
Mr. Mendes,&#8221; Stuart declared in a tone of resentment.</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case I think you had better let me send
in a message of some kind,&#8221; persisted his questioner.</p>

<p>Alistair flushed up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Mr. Mendes know I am here?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>The other shook his head slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Mendes&#8217; orders are very strict, and I am
obliged to respect them. I am not authorized to send
in a visitor&#8217;s card without some intimation of the
business on which he has come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair sat dismayed. A sense of impotence stole
over him, at the same time that the figure of the
man with whom he had been familiar for so long
began to grow larger and more formidable of outline
before his awakened eyes. All these precautions interposed
between him and the millionaire taught him
a new estimate of their respective positions in the
world. He, Alistair Stuart, might be called a lord,
but which of the two really was lord? His courtesy
title, his historic lineage, his royal friendships&mdash;all
these things might give him a sentimental prestige
in the eyes of women struggling on the fringe of society,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
and still cherishing the delusions of the snob.
But in this grim City office, where only realities counted,
what was he but a needy insolvent, regarded with
suspicion as a probable would-be borrower? The
feudal age was past, and the trappings of feudalism
stood revealed for the worthless, threadbare frippery
they were, as if a strong beam of daylight had suddenly
fallen on the painted canvas of a theatrical
scene. The feudal age was past, the old Viking race,
whose stone keeps dot the English shires, had gone
down, never to rise again, and to-day the barons of
steel were being broken in pieces by the barons of
gold.</p>

<p>While these reflections were passing in one compartment
of his brain in another the decision formed
itself to accept the conditions.</p>

<p>&#8220;My business is confidential,&#8221; he ventured first.</p>

<p>The intermediary bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in Mr. Mendes&#8217; confidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I have come on behalf of Don Juan.&#8221; And
seeing that the Pretender&#8217;s name made but a faint
impression on the confidential secretary, or whatever
he should be styled, Lord Alistair entered earnestly
into the history of the Prince, his claims, his hopes,
and his prospects of success, winding up with the
explanation that Don Juan had authorized him to
negotiate a loan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you offer security?&#8221; was the confidential man&#8217;s
sole comment on this appeal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>The question dragged Alistair promptly down from
the height of his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prince would guarantee repayment out of
the taxes, I suppose,&#8221; he said a little doubtfully. &#8220;Or
couldn&#8217;t he give concessions for railways, or mines, or
something? He would leave that to Mr. Mendes, I
should think.&#8221;</p>

<p>A very faint smile creased the mouth of the City
man. He took a slip of cardboard from a stand in
front of him, and wrote a few words on it: &#8220;Lord
A. Stuart. Loan for Pretender. No security.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this in his hand he rose and passed into an
adjoining room.</p>

<p>In less than a minute he returned, accompanied by
a younger man, who bowed respectfully to Lord
Alistair as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come to Mr. Mendes, my lord?&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair rose eagerly and followed him, feeling
pretty sure that the banker had been disengaged the
whole time. But the barriers he had had to surmount
had considerably weakened his self-confidence,
and he experienced a sensible relief when Mendes, rising
at his entrance, shook hands with his accustomed
friendliness, and offered him an easy-chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope my people haven&#8217;t bothered you too much,&#8221;
the millionaire said. &#8220;But you find me here with
my armour on, keeping guard over my money-bags.
Who is your royal friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair repeated the story he had just told in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
the other room, but in a distinctly lower key of
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;You met him with Des Louvres?&#8221; remarked the
Brazilian. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t Des Louvres come here, or,
better still, the Prince himself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will come, I have no doubt, if you are willing
to entertain his proposals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can hardly say that till I have seen him.&#8221; Mendes
touched a bell, and the young man who had introduced
Alistair promptly appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ascertain what is known in Rome about Prince
Don Juan de Bourbon, and let me know when I come
back from lunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man hesitated an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;The telephone does not go beyond Paris, sir,&#8221; he
said, speaking with just perceptible hesitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our agent there can telegraph on. Cipher.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mendes spoke quietly. As soon as the door had
closed on the young secretary, his employer made a
mark upon a sheet of paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t see that youth next time you come
here,&#8221; he observed to Stuart. &#8220;That is the second
time this week he has asked me to think for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair shivered as he heard the ruthless sentence.
A picture rose before him of a young man proud in
his employer&#8217;s favour, and filled with ambitious
dreams for the future, going home to an old mother,
or perhaps a newly-married bride, in some pleasant
little suburban home, and breaking the news that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
was ruined. It was in this way that money-bags were
guarded.</p>

<p>Mendes sat considering for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know why Rothschilds refused them, I
suppose?&#8221; he threw out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know they had applied to Rothschilds!&#8221;
exclaimed Alistair in astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;All these people do, as a rule. Rothschilds have
the name, you know. Every financial scheme that
gets floated in London goes there first. We smaller
men have to subsist on their leavings.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat up to his desk, and wrote a short note, which
he sealed up and addressed himself. Then he touched
the bell again, and handed it to the doomed young
man, whom Alistair gazed on with a fascinated
interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it yourself. They may see you. Now,&#8221; he
said, turning to Stuart, &#8220;come and have lunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mendes conducted his guest to a big club-house
behind the church at the corner of Lombard Street.
In the hall he stopped and wrote down Lord Alistair&#8217;s
name in the visitors&#8217; book with satisfaction. Regard
for race is a sentiment deeply rooted in the Semitic
mind, and Mendes took a genuine pleasure in the
thought that his companion was a descendant of Scottish
Kings.</p>

<p>They took their seats at a small table in the midst
of a vast room filled with similar ones, nearly all
of them inconveniently crowded. The lunchers were
mostly middle-aged men of prosperous appearance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
and their talk seemed to run chiefly on gambling as
it is carried on at the legalized Monte Carlo in Chapel
Court. They all spoke to each other without formality,
and a man who came and sat down at the same
table as Mendes and Stuart at once plunged into a
story of some speculator who had been gambling in
copper, and owing to an unexpected desertion of the
market by other speculators found himself suddenly
left with some hundreds of tons of ore on his hands,
which were actually brought in waggons to his office
in Billiter Buildings, where he had one small room
and a boy. The idea that a buyer and seller of anything
should be called upon actually to handle it evidently
appealed to the narrator as a superb joke.</p>

<p>Generally speaking the lunches were of a very substantial
description, and champagne seemed to be the
only wine in much demand. Mendes catered liberally
for his guest, and over their coffee offered him a
cigar which the Duke of Trent and Colonsay could
not have afforded to smoke. But most of the men
round them were smoking similar cigars. It was
impossible to think that everyone in that crowd was
as rich as Mendes. Alistair could only suppose that
they represented the winners of the moment, who
were spending their gains with a gambler&#8217;s recklessness
in the belief that their luck would never turn.</p>

<p>In this judgment he was not wholly right. The
world of the Stock Exchange is as small as other
worlds, and those who inhabit it have to consult the
opinions of their neighbours. If anything, the keeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
up of appearances was more important to these
gold-hunters than it is to the village tradesman or
the retired officer in his seaside villa. To have ordered
a modest lunch or a cheap cigar would have
been to hoist a signal of distress, perhaps to bring an
unstable fortune tumbling to the ground.</p>

<p>Among these earthen pots the solid vessels of
wealth floated calmly, sure sooner or later to crush
the greater part of their venturesome rivals. As they
rose from the table, Mendes moved his head slightly
in the direction of the story-teller.</p>

<p>&#8220;That man will not last six months,&#8221; he whispered.
&#8220;He has gone in for American rails.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they going down, then?&#8221; asked the ignorant
Stuart, attempting to adopt the jargon he had heard
around him.</p>

<p>Mendes smiled good-naturedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter whether they go up or down.
Dealing in American rails is playing roulette against
a croupier who can make the ball roll where he
likes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The spectacle of all these men feverishly engaged
in the hunt for gold had excited Alistair in sympathy.
For a moment he felt a pale reflex of their passion,
and wished that he too could be among the winners
instead of the losers.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do men make money?&#8221; he asked wistfully
of the millionaire.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one can make money,&#8221; the rich man replied
grimly, &#8220;in this world. He can only take it. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
the only way to take it is to be a little more greedy
and cunning than the man you take it from.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the gospel of Mammon. And Alistair
Stuart knew that here at least he could never find
salvation.</p>

<p>On their return to George Yard, Mendes was
stopped in the outer office by the gentleman who had
interviewed Alistair. He excused himself to Stuart
for a few minutes, and nearly a quarter of an hour
elapsed before Alistair again found himself in the
financier&#8217;s room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I have heard something about your friend,&#8221;
Mendes said grimly, as he sat down.</p>

<p>Alistair&#8217;s heart sank at the Brazilian&#8217;s tone. He
waited for him to speak.</p>

<p>Mendes went on deliberately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I ought to say I have heard something
about his father. I don&#8217;t suppose this young fellow
is anything more than a tool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you heard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard this: that the last time he got a
quarter of a million out of a confiding Greek in order
to make a descent on his kingdom, as he calls it, he
spent the whole of the money on his own pleasures,
without ever going within five hundred miles
of the frontier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think Don Juan would do that,&#8221; Alistair
protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will not get the chance,&#8221; the other said brutally.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
&#8220;We are going to lend no more money to these
kings of the hooligans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think he has no chance of success?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think those who are behind him want him
to succeed, if you are speaking of Don Juan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But whom do you mean? Who are behind him?&#8221;
asked the bewildered Stuart.</p>

<p>The South American gave him a doubtful glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a Catholic, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Alistair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Half a one, I suspect. All you people cling together,
I notice. Decadents, Legitimists, or whatever
you call yourselves, it comes to much the same thing.
I haven&#8217;t watched you all this time for nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not a Christian at all,&#8221; said Alistair.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has that got to do with it? That man
Des Louvres is about as much of a Christian as this
table, but he is a very good son of the Church&mdash;one
of the best agents they have got, I fancy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can assure you that you are mistaken if you think
I have any Catholic sympathies,&#8221; Alistair protested
emphatically. &#8220;I am a Pagan, pure and simple.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So is the Roman Church, according to the Protestants,&#8221;
sneered Mendes. &#8220;But I am quite ready to
take your word for it. I don&#8217;t suppose Des Louvres
has told you any more than he was obliged to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair remained silent, too much offended to
reply.</p>

<p>Mendes went on in a tone of quiet deliberation:</p>

<p>&#8220;The day of these Pretenders is over. A King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
who has been driven from the throne by a rival or
by a foreigner may have some chance of getting back
again. But these Latin princelets were turned out
because their own subjects were sick of their misgovernment,
and no one wants to try them again. After
all, people are not such fools as to prefer tyranny to
freedom. The sort of abject superstition on which
they rely is very strong, no doubt, till it is shaken,
but after it has once been upset you can no more
restore it than you can set up Humpty-Dumpty again.
Legitimism, as you call it, is not a popular sentiment;
it is only the fad of a clique of aristocrats who are
played out themselves. Such men do not make
revolutions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stuart made no attempt to resist this reasoning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you consider that Don Juan would have no
chance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never thought he had a chance of making himself
King, if that is what you mean. The only question
I have to consider is whether it would pay me
to give him a run.&#8221; And seeing Stuart&#8217;s bewilderment,
the financier added: &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been thinking
of the mines and the railways. An attempt of
this kind, if it looked at all serious, would send down
the price of every investment in the country, and if
I knew of it beforehand, I should be able to make
enough out of my knowledge to repay whatever I
gave your friend. I should never expect to get it
back from him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why won&#8217;t you give him the run?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>&#8220;I will tell you why. Because those who are behind
him, those from whom Des Louvres is pretty
sure to have his instructions, are simply putting this
poor young fellow forward to gain something for
themselves, and they will push him on or call him back
to suit their own purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean what Disraeli meant&mdash;and he was not altogether
a fool&mdash;when he said there were only two powers
at the bottom of everything that happened in
Europe&mdash;the Church and the secret societies. In this
case it is not the Freemasons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what do you suggest the Church has to
gain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it matters. Perhaps there is some
quarrel on between the Pope and the reigning dynasty;
perhaps there has been a movement to suppress
the monasteries or to expel the Jesuits&mdash;I don&#8217;t
know. I haven&#8217;t been following their recent history.
But you may take it from me that the Vatican has
some motive for putting pressure on somebody or
some party in the country, and that Don Juan is to
be used as the red light.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair could not resist the conviction that Mendes
was probably right. He did not feel any personal
interest in the matter one way or the other, except
as it affected the chance of his being able to take
part in an interesting adventure. He had, perhaps,
a slight friendliness left for the Church of Rome; at
all events, he would have felt no reluctance to fight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
its battles as long as in so doing he was fighting
against the social system for which Mendes stood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even if you are right,&#8221; he urged as a last appeal,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what difference it need make to you, as
long as the expedition takes place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot be sure that it will take place.&#8221; The
Brazilian paused a moment, and then added gravely:
&#8220;You know that I am a Jew.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair looked at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not disposed to let myself be used as a puppet
by the friends of Monsieur des Louvres. We
have seen rather too much lately of the true feeling
of the Roman Church towards our race. The Dreyfus
case has been a revelation of more things than the
innocence of Captain Dreyfus. We now know what
treatment we have to expect from Rome if she ever
does regain power, and no penny of my money shall
ever be given to help her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rome is not so bad as Russia,&#8221; said Stuart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Russia&#8217;s turn is coming,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;There
is a curse on those who persecute our race.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Alistair shivered again.</p>

<p>Alistair went home feeling as though he had been
in possession for a brief moment of the magic bell
of northern folklore, which enables its wearer to
descend into the bowels of the earth and see the
gnomes at their work. He had a vision in which he
seemed to have been walking below the surface of
the great city among the foundations of palaces. On
either hand the tremendous walls rose up, immovable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
forbidding, and dank with the underground slime.
These were the mighty bases of the powers of wealth,
against which he had set his feeble shoulder in the
foolish expectation that he could make them rock.
And the puny effort had left him beating out his life
down there in the subterranean mire at the foot of
those sunless piles among the forgotten pauper rubbish
of the world.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


<small>ROYAL PATRONAGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> his arrival at the house, weighed down by this
new and dreary sense of discomfiture, Alistair found
Molly in a state of pleased excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a letter for you from Easterthorpe. It&#8217;s
from the Duke of Gloucester!&#8221; was her greeting.</p>

<p>Alistair flushed as he recognized Prince Herbert&#8217;s
handwriting. He had not forgotten the bazaar, and
he tore open the envelope with some fear of encountering
a reproach.</p>

<p>The Duke addressed him as &#8220;Dear Alistair,&#8221; just
as in their boyish days, and begged him to come down
to Gloucester Lodge for the week-end.</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be no one here but my wife and children,&#8221;
the royal note ended, &#8220;and we can talk about
old times.&#8221;</p>

<p>Left to himself, Alistair would have declined the
invitation, in spite of the courtly theory that invitations
from such a quarter are in the nature of commands.
He was too much disgusted with the way
in which life had dealt with him, and he with life,
to have any more heart in the struggle. It would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
simpler to go under, to efface himself, and cease to
keep before the world.</p>

<p>But he found that Molly was determined that he
should go. She had made up her mind that the
Prince&#8217;s invitation was a repudiation of the Duke of
Trent, and an intimation that Stuart&#8217;s irregular connection
with herself had not lowered him in the royal
estimation.</p>

<p>Alistair, of course, knew better. He saw perfectly
well that Prince Herbert&#8217;s reference to his family
was a delicate way of saying that the visit must be a
private one. The <i>Court Circular</i> would not know of
Lord Alistair&#8217;s presence at Gloucester Lodge.</p>

<p>For this reason his acceptance was a little stiffer
than the Prince&#8217;s invitation. He began it &#8220;My dear
Prince,&#8221; and signed himself &#8220;Yours ever.&#8221; The
Prince had written &#8220;Yours affectionately.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Alistair was a good deal more
touched by the overture than he was willing to betray.</p>

<p>He had not yet been adjudicated a bankrupt. But
the Duke of Trent had suspended negotiations on his
behalf, and he was to meet his creditors on the Monday
to undergo the customary useless cross-examination
as to how he had managed to get rid of the
money.</p>

<p>At the very moment of departure he was confronted
with the new difficulty of cash. Neither he
nor Molly found themselves in possession of the price
of a first-class ticket, and Alistair was too proud to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
go on such a visit unless he could do so in the way
befitting his rank.</p>

<p>He solved the problem by ordering a cab to drive
him to the railway-station, and making it stop at a
famous pawnbroker&#8217;s on the way. It was his first
visit to such an establishment, but the prospect of
the journey put him in good spirits, and he tendered
his French watch to the shopman with a certain enjoyment
of the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going down to stay with the Duke of Gloucester,
and I haven&#8217;t got my railway-fare,&#8221; he said,
with perfect self-possession.</p>

<p>The shopman grinned at what appeared to him a
lively witticism, and after examining the piece, offered
ten pounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;What name shall I put?&#8221; he inquired, as Alistair
signified his consent, preparing to write &#8220;Jackson&#8221; or
&#8220;Thompson,&#8221; at his customer&#8217;s pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stuart&mdash;Lord Alistair Stuart,&#8221; came in the same
assured tone.</p>

<p>This time the pawnbroker laughed out.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will have your joke, sir. I&#8217;ll put &#8216;Mr.
Stuart.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have told you my name,&#8221; said Alistair.
&#8220;You can see it on my coat if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>He slipped off the light overcoat he was wearing,
and gravely exhibited to the eyes of the wondering
shopman the tailor&#8217;s parchment label, on which his
name and rank were clearly legible.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your lordship&#8217;s pardon, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; stammered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
the man. &#8220;It&#8217;s so seldom that our clients give
us their real names that I thought your lordship was
pretending. The address, please?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Care of Miss Finucane, Elm Side, Chelsea.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shopman, scarcely able to believe his ears,
wrote down the address with an amazement which he
made no attempt to conceal. As he handed over the
ticket he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Would your lordship like a cheap watch to wear
while this is with us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, no,&#8221; said Alistair, with easy indifference.
&#8220;Time is of no consequence to me just now&mdash;I am a
bankrupt.&#8221;</p>

<p>He strolled out of the shop, charmed with his victory
over the hateful traditions of hypocrisy and self-shame
embodied in the pawnbroker. In his exhilaration
he could have challenged the whole middle
class.</p>

<p>His spirits rose steadily as he came to the terminus,
and he lavished half a crown on the porter who carried
his light dressing-case to the railway-carriage.</p>

<p>He found himself intruding on the privacy of a
stout, vulgar-looking man of sixty or thereabouts,
whose name was too freely displayed over all his
belongings, from a giant portmanteau down to a rug-strap,
to leave the least observant fellow-passenger
ignorant of his identity. It was the great Sir Gilbert
Lawthorn, whose discovery that pickles could be sold
three-halfpence a bottle cheaper than the prevailing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
price, and still be made to yield a profit, had earned
him seven hundred thousand pounds and a baronetcy.</p>

<p>This great personage scowled on the inspector who
admitted Stuart into his compartment, and then, after
a scornful glance at the modest dressing-case, he remarked
rudely:</p>

<p>&#8220;I generally have a carriage reserved for me, but
this time I thought no one would be in the train. Are
you going far?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to Easterthorpe,&#8221; said Alistair, lowering
a window.</p>

<p>The pickle-seller gazed at him in displeasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I live there,&#8221; he announced, with conscious superiority.
&#8220;My place is close to the Prince&#8217;s. I don&#8217;t
think I have seen you in the neighbourhood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going down to stay with friends,&#8221; said
Stuart carelessly, as he took up a paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do your friends know the Prince?&#8221; Sir Gilbert
inquired, with patronage. &#8220;He called on me last
week.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair lowered his paper and looked at the fat baronet
over with unfeigned surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not the honour of your acquaintance, sir,&#8221;
he said deliberately, beginning to read again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Sir Gilbert Lawthorn!&#8221; burst out the indignant
magnate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. Your pickles are excellent,&#8221; replied
Alistair. And this time he was allowed to read his
paper in peace.</p>

<p>When the train stopped at Easterthorpe a groom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
in neat black livery appeared at the door of the carriage,
and touched his hat. Sir Gilbert, who evidently
recognized him, took the salute to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Royal Highness is not in here,&#8221; he proclaimed
pompously. &#8220;Did you expect him by this
train?&#8221;</p>

<p>The groom, without replying, took the case which
Lord Alistair passed out to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;This way, my lord, if you please,&#8221; he said deferentially,
as Alistair prepared to follow his luggage.</p>

<p>The baronet turned crimson.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I beg your pardon,&#8221; he stammered awkwardly,
half holding out his hand. &#8220;I had no idea that
you were going to stay with the Prince.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Alistair was not in a merciful mood as far as
the middle class was concerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who the devil do you suppose cares what you
think, or who you are, or anything about you? I
wish I had come third class.&#8221;</p>

<p>He followed the secretly delighted servant out to
a smart dogcart, and Sir Gilbert Lawthorn&#8217;s fat
coachman meekly drew a heavy barouche and two fat
horses out of the way of the royal conveyance.</p>

<p>It was with a slight sense of embarrassment that
Alistair entered the pleasant dwelling in which the
Duke of Gloucester and his wife were able to enjoy
some of the pleasures of English home life. But
his uneasiness was quickly dispelled by the reception
he found waiting for him. The Prince himself sprang
up from a lounge chair in the bright little hall, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
grasped him cordially by the hand, exclaiming as he
did so:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ada, my dear, here is my old chum, Alistair
Stuart.&#8221;</p>

<p>A woman some years younger than her husband,
with a face in which womanly grace and keen intelligence
were harmoniously united, rose from the midst
of a group of small children, and offered her hand
with equal friendliness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so glad you have come. I have heard so
much about you from Bertie that I hope you will
let me treat you as an old friend. Do you like
children?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was evident that children liked Alistair, for almost
before he had sat down two youngsters of five
or six, in white sailors&#8217; suits, were romping round
him, while a small girl of three, safely sheltered by
her mother&#8217;s skirts, regarded him with grave but
friendly curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know something about you,&#8221; the elder boy said
presently, with an amusing note of condescension in
his voice. &#8220;You used to go fishing with father when
he was a boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair remembered the unfortunate letter he had
sent to the Legitimist bazaar, and was ashamed.</p>

<p>The tactful Princess gave him no time to indulge
in such thoughts. She poured him out a cup of tea,
and bade her eldest son carry a plate of toast to the
visitor&mdash;an order which he obeyed with an evident
sense that he was conferring a considerable favour.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>Lord Alistair was not long in awakening in the
mind of the Duchess of Gloucester the same feeling
that he awakened in most good women&mdash;a regret that
such a life should be running to waste, and a desire
to save him. It happened that the Duchess had literary
tastes, she had heard of Stuart&#8217;s poems, and
she engaged him in conversation on that ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you given up writing?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
think you have published anything for a long time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everyone has given up writing,&#8221; Alistair returned
with a bitterness that surprised himself. It had grown
up in his mind unconsciously; his literary disappointments
had become part of his general feud with the
successful order of mankind.</p>

<p>The look on the face of the Princess made him
hasten to explain himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;The English public will not tolerate literature;
that is the simple truth. The publishers will not
publish it, the booksellers will not sell it, the public
will not read it, and the police have orders to suppress
it. My old publisher told me plainly the other day
that it was a waste of time to print anything but four-and-sixpenny
novels. He said the booksellers have
got used to making up their accounts in items of four-and-sixpence,
and they consider it a nuisance to handle
anything else. And even the novels are falling
more and more into a stereotyped pattern; they must
be exactly the same length&mdash;a hundred thousand
words, I think he said&mdash;and be written well down to
the level of the vulgar provincial mind.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>&#8220;Surely things are not quite so bad as that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very nearly. The worst of it is that the persecution
of literature is purely for reasons of hypocrisy.
The public likes what it calls immorality&mdash;will have
it, in fact: no book that is really pure has much chance
of success&mdash;but it insists on the writer pandering to
the proprieties. Either he must slobber over his
adulteress in the Nonconformist vein, or else he must
tell the whole thing in an epigrammatic falsetto. It
is a choice between &#8216;East Lynne&#8217; and &#8216;The Innocence
of Henrietta.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But are there no writers before the public now
whom you look upon as on a higher level?&#8221; And
the Princess suggested one or two names.</p>

<p>Stuart shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is their position?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Granted that
they have genius, the conditions of the age give them
no chance. Unless they go on producing, and keeping
themselves constantly before the public, they are
cast on one side. The greatest genius, as a rule, can
only give the world one or two masterpieces. Coleridge
wrote three short poems, Poe a dozen short stories.
Dante and Cervantes each wrote one book&mdash;their
other work is of no account. Everyone of them
would have starved to-day, just as they starved in
their own day, while the vulgar novelists made fortunes
round them. Writers such as you speak of have
to go on writing worse and worse, conscious of their
own degradation, and freely reminded of it by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
press, and by their publishers&#8217; accounts. It is the torture
of the damned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me there ought to be some remedy,&#8221;
the Princess said thoughtfully. &#8220;I know so many
rich men who seem to me only anxious to find some
way of doing good with their money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man of genius does not like to accept charity.
The rich men would expect too much gratitude. They
prefer building cathedrals&mdash;each poem of Coleridge
is worth a cathedral&mdash;but you could not expect a millionaire
to see that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are pensions, and literary funds, are there
not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pensions, yes, for the bad writers who have fallen
below the level of even the British public. And there
are literary funds, yes. I was once asked to act as
a steward at one of their annual dinners. The secretary
sent me the rules, by which I saw that no grant
was ever made to writers whose lives or whose works
were open to objection on religious or moral grounds.
I wrote back to say that I did not see my way to support
a literary fund from whose benefits Shakespeare
and Shelley would have been excluded.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Princess saw that she was handling a sore.
She sighed, and changed the conversation.</p>

<p>After dinner Prince Herbert played billiards with
his guest, and their talk ran on the past. Alistair
was softened by the boyish memories recalled by his
old playfellow, and when he went to bed it was with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
more peaceful and happier thoughts than had come to
him for a long time.</p>

<p>He was sipping his cup of tea in bed the next morning
when he heard light footsteps, followed by excited
whispering, outside his door. The next moment
the handle was turned cautiously, and then the
door was thrust open with a bang, and two small boys
invaded the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;May we come in?&#8221; demanded the elder. And
satisfied with the expression on Lord Alistair&#8217;s face,
he turned and beckoned through the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right; don&#8217;t be afraid, Tissy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The apprehension felt by the unseen Tissy communicated
itself to Alistair, who hastened to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you better go away till I&#8217;ve dressed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We want to stay and see you dress,&#8221; the leader
responded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not worth seeing, I assure you,&#8221; said Alistair.
&#8220;I dress very badly.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed doubtful whether the excuse would be
accepted, when fortunately a warning cry was heard
from the doorway, and a voice as of one speaking
with authority called out: &#8220;Come here directly!&#8221;</p>

<p>The head of the invading party cast a hasty glance
round the room, and only remarking regretfully to
his brother: &#8220;I can&#8217;t <i>see</i> his teeth,&#8221; withdrew in good
order.</p>

<p>Stuart did not offer to accompany his hosts to their
little country church. But the sight of the family
party setting out across the park, and the far-off sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
of the bell, had a soothing effect upon his spirit. Contrast
is the secret of all beauty, and perhaps the prodigal
had never considered how much of their charm
would depart from the rocks and valleys of Bohemia
were there no Puritan plain without.</p>

<p>In the afternoon he found himself left alone with
the Princess, after they had taken tea in the garden.
The scent of the roses was all about them, and the
bees drummed restlessly as they went by. It was a
perfect piece of English landscape, and the perfect
type of English womanhood fitted into it like a picture
in its natural frame.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Alistair,&#8221; she said, with quiet seriousness,
&#8220;I want to ask you if you will let the Prince help
you. He has never forgotten your boyish friendship;
he is attached to you still, and he only wants to see
his way clear to do something for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair murmured an expression of gratitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you will look on me as a friend too,&#8221; the
Duchess of Gloucester went on. &#8220;Will you let me
speak to you frankly, and will you be frank with me
in return?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you pardon me if I am?&#8221; asked Alistair.
&#8220;It is easy for some men to be frank; but when I am
frank I find I only shock good people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why should that be so? Are you sure that
when you are shocking good people, as you put it, it
is your true self that is speaking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam, I do not know what is my true self; or
if I have got one any longer. I used to have one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
when I was a boy, but twenty years of enforced hypocrisy
have pretty well knocked it out of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Princess sighed, and paused for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I can help you to find it. Do you really
love the woman you are living with?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; The truth came up from the depth of his
consciousness, exploded by surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why don&#8217;t you leave her?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Alistair&#8217;s turn to pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has given up everything for me. Sometimes
I think I ought to marry her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What had she to give up?&#8221;</p>

<p>This question offered a new light to Alistair, and
he took time to consider it. He might have answered
superficially that Molly had, in fact, given up the
offers of Mendes; and latterly she had given up a
great many pleasures that almost ranked as necessities
for her. But he saw the point of Princess Adelaide&#8217;s
question. What Molly had done was to quit
the life of a courtesan for that of a concubine, with
some prospect of becoming a wife. Now, a swimmer
who climbs on to a raft to save him from exhaustion
can hardly be said to give up the sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you consider that she has a greater claim on
you than your mother?&#8221; the Princess unfortunately
added.</p>

<p>This time Alistair answered deliberately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I do not consider that my mother has any
claim on me whatever. In my opinion the obligations
of a child towards its parents are trifling beside those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
of the parent to the child. My mother has been the
worst enemy I have had. She has been to me the
ordinary type of the Christian persecutor, the race
of the Inquisitors and Nonconformists and Churchmen
of every church. I have forgiven her because
she does not know how wicked she has been. Her
crimes are the crimes of her creed. Her brain has
been warped and maimed by the training she herself
received, as much as the foot of a Chinese girl is
warped and maimed by bandages to make it small.
I forgive her, and I think I love her, but I should
no more think of trying to shape my life according
to her prejudices than if she were a cannibal and
wanted me to eat human flesh.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess of Gloucester felt that she had bound
herself in honour not to show any disapproval of these
outspoken utterances. But she began to see what
Lord Alistair meant by saying that it is not equally
easy for all men to be frank.</p>

<p>She returned to the subject of Molly Finucane.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me that you must leave this woman
sooner or later, and that you will never have a better
opportunity than now. If you really feel that you
owe her anything, I don&#8217;t think you would find it
impossible to get your friends to make some provision
for her, if she needs it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair remembered Mendes and his empty house.
He did not think Molly was likely to be in need if
he left her.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what should I do?&#8221; he asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>The unexpected question baffled the Princess for a
moment. She had not heard of Hero Vanbrugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Return to your literary work,&#8221; she suggested.
&#8220;You have not the excuse of being obliged to write
something that will sell. Write to please yourself,
and in time you will find your audience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were to write to please myself, the world and
my own family in particular would think worse of
me than they do at present.&#8221; And seeing that the
Princess was not disposed to interrupt him, he went
on: &#8220;The supreme sin in English eyes is truthfulness.
Truthful thinking, truthful speaking, and truthful
living are all equally under the ban. And the
worst of it is that those who clamour most for freedom
of thought are most severe on freedom of life,
and those who live most freely are the least tolerant
of free speech. The Dissenter persecutes the sportsman,
and the sportsman persecutes the sage. All
the racing men I have ever met have been bigoted
High Churchmen, who would have cheerfully burnt
Darwin and the late Mr. Spurgeon. And if they had
begun with Darwin, they would have had Spurgeon&#8217;s
help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Princess Adelaide sat silent for some time. The
task of rescuing Alistair Stuart seemed to be more
difficult than she and her husband had foreseen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we could help you,&#8221; she said gently, at
last.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I am not to be helped,&#8221; Alistair confessed
sadly. &#8220;When I look back over my life, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
seems to me that ever since I was twelve years old I
have been surrounded by people knocking me over
the head, and saying to me: &#8216;Don&#8217;t be Alistair Stuart.&#8217;
I have tried not to be Alistair Stuart, but I
have failed. And the worst of it is that I am no
longer ashamed of being Alistair Stuart. It seems to
me that all these complaints ought to be addressed
to my Creator. I did not make myself: God made
me; let Him repent, not me.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />


<small>VIRTUE TRIUMPHANT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Prince and Princess were obliged to confess
to each other, when Lord Alistair was gone, that they
had failed to find a way of unravelling the tangle of
his life.</p>

<p>In reality they had done more than they knew.
Their kindly treatment of him, coming just at the
moment when he felt himself a social Ishmael, rejected
by all classes in turn, had given him back no
small portion of his self-respect. He could not help
contrasting the delicate attentions of Prince Herbert,
the representative of the greatest House in Europe,
and an English gentleman to boot, with the pretentious
compliments of the poor waif of royalty from
the Mediterranean whose bogus honours he had
stooped to accept a day or two before.</p>

<p>Nor could he resist the incense to his pride offered
by the clumsy abasement of the pickle-selling baronet.
It was something to feel that he still excited the envy
of the Lawthorns and the Mendes. He might be a
bankrupt, but he was still Lord Alistair Stuart, and
heir to one of the greatest titles of Britain. The
highest in the land still felt affection for him; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
noblest women thought him worthy of their
concern.</p>

<p>These reflections accompanied him on the way up
to town the next morning, and prepared him to face
his public examination with a lighter heart. After
all, bankruptcy was not fatal to a man in his position.
He had nothing to lose. His creditors could not take
the allowance made him by his brother. But for
Molly, indeed, he need not be a bankrupt at all. But
for her, and his quixotic refusal to abandon her, the
proceedings against him would have been dropped
already, and he himself would be enjoying the traditional
honours of the returned prodigal.</p>

<p>Why had he refused to leave Molly? After all,
was it not true that he had exaggerated Molly&#8217;s claim
on him? She had preferred him to Mendes, doubtless,
but her choice had not been taken from any exalted
motive of self-sacrifice. If it had been inspired
by the hope that he would marry her, it was a selfish
choice enough. She knew pretty well that Mendes
would never do that. Yes, his refusal to leave her
had been quixotic&mdash;that was the right word. For
her own sake, since it was evident that she shrank
from facing poverty with him, for her own sake it
would have been better to say good-bye.</p>

<p>The public examination did not turn out to be a
very formidable ordeal. Lord Alistair, who was at
his best when he was on his defence against the Philistines,
came through it with flying colours. The advocate
engaged by his creditors to bully him in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
approved professional style bullied in vain. The
bankrupt&#8217;s answers were in the lightest vein of good-natured
irresponsibility. He declared that he kept
no accounts, had no idea what he spent, only bought
the things his tradesmen teased him to buy, and felt
confident of his ability to pay for everything if these
unwise proceedings had not been sprung upon him.
The creditors present began to fear they were unwise,
it being evident that they could not hope to recover
from Lord Alistair even enough to pay their demolished
barrister. In the end they were glad to adjourn
the examination in the hope that the Duke of Trent
might yet be induced to make an offer on his brother&#8217;s
behalf.</p>

<p>Before he went home Alistair had the gratification
of seeing his name once more on the news-bills of the
evening papers, but this time accompanied by editorial
compliments, such as &#8220;Insolvent&#8217;s Witty Replies,&#8221;
&#8220;Calls his Creditors Unwise,&#8221; and so on. It
was a brilliant victory, and the middle class had never
been made to look more ridiculous.</p>

<p>Alistair got back to Chelsea sooner than he expected,
and found the house empty. After letting
himself in with his latchkey, he rang the bell to ask
if the mistress of the house had left any message for
him, but no one answered the summons.</p>

<p>The household arrangements were so irregular that
there was nothing very surprising in all the servants
being out together. Nevertheless, one of those subtle
sensations which we call presentiments warned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
Alistair that the emptiness of the house was a sign of
crisis.</p>

<p>He took the trouble to go down into the kitchens.
There, as he had already foreboded, he found everything
lying about in disorder. The dirty plates and
dishes from lunch were heaped up in the sink, and
the fire in the range had died out. He could find
no shoes or umbrellas or other belongings of the
servants, such as they would be likely to keep downstairs.</p>

<p>Already convinced that the servants had deserted
the house, or been dismissed in a body, he mounted
to the top floor, and had his judgment confirmed by
the state of the attics. All the trunks were gone.
The beds had been made, no doubt in the forenoon,
before the crash, but everything else wore an untidy
and dismantled air. The homely dressing-tables
looked bare without the presence of brushes, and there
was dirty water in one of the wash-stand basins. Several
drawers stood half out of the various chests,
showing bits of paper, broken buttons, and an odd
glove.</p>

<p>It was the first time Lord Alistair had ever visited
this part of the house, and the whole spectacle depressed
him. He found himself pitying the departed
servants who had had to occupy such mean and desolate
quarters. Why should it be necessary for these
fellow-creatures to pass their lives so shabbily? Why
should one man be worse off than another? And
that sensation of a spiritual kinship between himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
and all the underlings of the world, which had first
come to him as he stood on Westminster Bridge, returned
like a wave of melancholy over his heart.</p>

<p>Instead of going downstairs again, he went to the
window of the attic in which he happened to find himself,
and looked out. It was a glimpse of back-door
London&mdash;that unknown London which hides behind
the stately squares and fashionable terraces and busy
rows of shops. At that hour a mist breathed on the
roofs and gables of the houses, making them beautiful.
Each particular chimney was invested with a
romantic air, and had a character of its own. There
were two, a tall one with a little one beside it, at
the end of a long roof-comb, and the group suggested
a stately lady leading her child by the hand. Behind
them came a short squat chimney that might have
been the maid carrying a bundle. Farther along a
pair of slender, crooked chimney-pots bent towards
each other, like two beaux of the eighteenth-century
meeting and bowing on the Pantiles.</p>

<p>Looking lower down, another world revealed itself.
Here were small yards in which a little grass grew of
its own accord, and tall, gaunt clothes-props were
the substitutes for trees. Strange barrels that could
have nothing in them were stacked against a wall
to rot away. The backs of the next row of houses
were divided from these yards by a mysterious lane
that led nowhere. To the right there was just visible
a little branch street, with houses on only one side
of it. Such small houses they were, with a door and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
three windows to each, and yet in the ground-floor
window of one of them there was actually a card, as
if it had lodgings to let.</p>

<p>More interesting than the houses in the side-street
were those just opposite, across the mysterious lane.
By looking closely it was possible to see something
of the life that went on in them. People came out
of their back-doors into the little yards which opened
into the lane. Watching these people was like watching
the inhabitants of another planet; they might live
there for years, and you live in your house for years,
and you might watch each other every day all that
time, and yet you would never become anything to
them, nor they to you. They might be born, and
grow up, and marry, and die, and you would never
know so much as their names.</p>

<p>Compared with the commonplace sights of the
front streets, this was like a peep into the wonder-world.
The sky was turning from yellow to violet
under the enchantment of sunset, and all the air
seemed to be full of a deep sigh. Wicked faces began
to peer from the bricks of the houses, and the
chimneys, if they were looked at long enough, really
moved and nodded to each other as if they were communicating
secrets overhead. Even the clothes-props
down below felt the influence, and came to life, and
the clothes on the lines changed into ghostly people
whispering to and nudging one another as the darkness
gave them courage. It was impossible to believe
that this was London, that the Underground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
Railway ran beneath, and that the hospital stood not
far off. It was easier to think that you had strayed
into the heart of some haunted town, thousands of
years ago, wherein dwelt a mystic folk, worshipping
strange gods, and going about the streets of their
doomed city, noiseless and hushed.</p>

<p>The sudden stopping of wheels outside, and the
instant clamour of a bell, broke Alistair&#8217;s trance.
With the dazed feeling of a man just recalled from
sleep he stumbled down the stairs, and opened the
front-door to Molly.</p>

<p>She marched in, dressed in her most extravagant
clothes, with a hat, which Alistair could not remember
seeing before, on her head, and a more than usually
profuse display of jewels on her arms and hands.
Her cheeks were bright with rouge and powder, and
there was a hard, metallic glint in her eyes which
warned him that she had been drinking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, old boy, how did you get on?&#8221; she burst
out, in a voice tainted with huskiness. &#8220;I had a
row with the servants while you were away, and
sacked the whole lot of them, and a good thing too.
Jump into my carriage, and we&#8217;ll go off and have a
nice little dinner at the Savoy or wherever you like,
and a box at the theatre after. Cheer up!&#8221;</p>

<p>While she was rattling on with an evident anxiety
not to give him time to think, Alistair was glancing
from her painted face to her jewelled fingers, and
from the new hat to the coup&eacute; which had brought her
to the house.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>&#8220;Come in here,&#8221; he said, in a quiet tone of authority,
at the same time closing the front-door.</p>

<p>He led the way into the drawing-room, Molly following
with reluctant steps, and a look of defiance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what is it? What do you want to say
now?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have you come from?&#8221; asked Alistair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have I come from? What business is
that of yours? I can go where I like, can&#8217;t I? I&#8217;ve
been shopping, if you want to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you get the money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind! What money? Can&#8217;t I have a
little money of my own? I&#8217;ve been giving you money
lately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you have. And I&#8217;m very sorry I let you.
But that was money you got on your jewels, and I
gave you some of them myself. You have been getting
some more since I went away, and I want to
know where you got it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose I borrowed it; what&#8217;s that to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who lent it to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t tell you. You&#8217;ve no right to ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I know I have no right over you. But I have
the right to say I won&#8217;t eat a dinner without knowing
who is paying for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall pay for it; isn&#8217;t that enough?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With whose money? You have just admitted
that you had been borrowing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I borrowed it from Carter&#8217;s&mdash;there!&#8221;</p>

<p>Stuart shrugged his shoulders disdainfully.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>&#8220;Where did you think I got it from, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From Mendes. I don&#8217;t know anyone else who
would be likely to lend you money.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Molly wavered between wrath and
fear. Then something in Alistair&#8217;s face overcame
her, and she broke down in a whimper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be angry with me, Alistair! Don&#8217;t look
like that. I didn&#8217;t know what to do. The servants
all left me, I had nowhere to go, and we&#8217;ve been so
hard up lately. I thought you wanted money badly.
It was for you more than for myself, really. I was
afraid you would get tired of living with me if we
were poor. You threatened to give up the house and
everything only the other day; you know you did. I
didn&#8217;t think you would mind my borrowing a little
from him&mdash;he&#8217;s your friend as well as mine. I didn&#8217;t
go to his house, only to his office in the City; and
he was awfully good, and gave me a hundred pounds
at once, and told me to come again when I wanted
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair remembered his own reception in Mendes&#8217;
office.</p>

<p>&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t have given the hundred pounds to
me,&#8221; was all he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&mdash;you&#8217;re not going!&#8221; Molly screamed, as she
saw him turning from her. &#8220;Alistair! Alistair!&#8221;</p>

<p>She cast herself on the ground before him and
caught him by the foot, in a paroxysm of sobs and
wails.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry for you, Molly. I&#8217;m not angry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
with you at all; I&#8217;ve no right to be; but I can&#8217;t live
with you any longer; you must see that. I fancied
it would come to this sooner or later. I don&#8217;t blame
you; I dare say I ought to blame myself. But I can&#8217;t
live on money that another man gives you; you must
know that well enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give it back to him. I haven&#8217;t spent half of
it. I&#8217;ll take it all back to him to-morrow. I&#8217;ll sell
something to make it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>She began desperately tearing off bracelets and
rings and dropping them on the floor.</p>

<p>But Alistair&#8217;s mind was made up. He was surprised
to find how perfectly easy it was for him to
act now that the moment had come. He had not
known that he should be so glad to be free.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing that you could do now would alter the
fact that you have taken money from Mendes,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We may as well make up our minds to what
has happened. It was bound to come sooner or later.
It is better to part like this than to drag on till we
should be both sick of each other. It&#8217;s good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will never speak to Mendes again. I will never
see him,&#8221; sobbed Molly.</p>

<p>Stuart took a step towards the door of the room.
She sprang to her feet and got in front of him, clinging
round him to prevent his going. The scene became
dreadful and ugly. He had to struggle step
by step out of the room and into the hall. It was
a fight to get his hat off the stand and put it on.
He felt that it was imperative that he should get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
away there and then. Another hour spent with Molly
would be irretrievable dishonour. At the front-door
the miserable woman made a still more frantic struggle.
He had to unclasp her fingers by main force,
and to thrust her back with one hand while he turned
the latch with the other. If he had not promptly
slipped his foot in between door and doorpost she
would have slammed the door to again before he
could open it. And all the time she kept up an incessant
wailing appeal to him for mercy. For the
first time in his life Alistair felt that he was doing a
cruel thing.</p>

<p>He was still shuddering from the sound of Molly&#8217;s
last moan as he got into a cab at the street-corner and
gave the direction:</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonsay House.&#8221;</p>

<small>MAGIC CASEMENTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Alistair</span> stood on the deck of a Channel
steamer and watched the coast of England melt into
the night.</p>

<p>His mood was burthened with that indignant melancholy
which swelled the heart of Byron and of
Whistler, and many another exile whom the builders
of the Raj have rejected from their midst. In the
Tate Gallery hangs a painting which he had often
gazed upon, a symbolic masterpiece of Watts&#8217;. It
represents hard-heartedness sitting crowned with gold
and robed in scarlet on the throne of the world. The
painter has called his figure &#8220;Mammon&#8221;; it came before
Alistair just then as the image of England&mdash;the
England that stones her prophets and worships her
swindlers; the England that made Burns a gauger and
one Perceval Prime Minister; that chained the dying
Napoleon on an ocean rock, and rejected the last
prayer of Nelson; England, with her shop-keeper&#8217;s
conscience, where art is a sin and generosity a crime.</p>

<p>A sense of exultation and relief accompanied his
thoughts. He was escaping from the Puritan prison
against whose bars his spirit had so often bruised its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
wings. In the obtuse self-satisfaction, in the unctuous
mercy, of its keepers he had felt something more
merciless than in all the recorded cruelties of furious
saints and frantic Emperors. Not the snow-peaks
of Switzerland, he told himself, not the Shakespearean
cadences of Venice, nor Rome with her memories
and marbles, afforded that zest to wandering which
greets us like a scent on foreign soil. It was the
sense of freedom from that chain of custom and convention
which we forge upon ourselves. The Mediterranean
filled her coasts with pleasure cities which
were cities of refuge from the middle class. The
Niagara of gold that poured from England was the
price the English tradesman pays for his vindictive
respectability. It was the tax on spite.</p>

<p>A moist wind thick with delicious sea-smells, that
mounted in the brain like wine, lifted him out of his
vexed meditation as the steamer drew clear of the
tangled lights of Spithead and came out on the wide
moonlit pavement of the sea. His mother joined him
on the deck, and they sat and watched the broad moon
sail aloft like a luminous balloon scattering glory.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like it to be like this always,&#8221; Alistair
sighed in ecstasy.</p>

<p>A sense of utter peace had fallen on his spirit, worn
out with striving. The molten orb, lifting beyond
the shadow of the earth, seemed to drag his soul upward
as a spar is sucked in the wake of a great ship.
He looked up and longed after that visible Elysium,
that floating Island of the Blest on which the happy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
dead voyaged in light for ever across a sea buoyed
with stars. That ship of souls, on what far coasts
did it touch? within what magic roadsteads anchor?
What wondrous cities went forth to greet the mariners
of that immortal Odyssey?</p>

<p>The yearnings of a thousand generations who have
spelled in the heavens for some divine boding of the
fates of men; the mystic soundings of devout astronomers
in temple labyrinths beside old Nile; the vision
conned upon the starlit terraces of Babylonian towers&mdash;all
these forgotten intimations from his pre-natal
life surged in upon him in waves of deep emotion,
and floated his consciousness from its moorings among
the things of every day.</p>

<p>Caroline sat beside her son and did not break the
silence. She, too, was happy. Her prayers had been
granted; the prodigal had found his way home.
Within the compass of her simple mind there was
room for only one ending to the story. Conversion
would follow on repentance, and a happy marriage
would insure a regular and fortunate career.</p>

<p>Her agitated joy over his return to Colonsay
House had moved Alistair, if not to repentance, to a
wish that he could change his nature in accordance
with the life his mother wanted him to lead. In
the first moments of united tenderness he even persuaded
himself that this might be so. He was wearied
and disheartened by his warfare with society, and
he hoped that the truce might ripen into a peace.</p>

<p>The Duke of Trent&#8217;s reception of his brother had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
been courteous, if not very cordial. He bade him
welcome to the house, and on the following evening
informed him in their mother&#8217;s presence that the
family solicitor had taken charge of his affairs.</p>

<p>Alistair saw that he was expected to be grateful,
and he succeeded in appearing so, though in his heart
he was half sorry to accept his brother&#8217;s favours for
the sake of his creditors.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it were not for you I would not let Trent give
a penny to these people,&#8221; he told his mother when
they were by themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not only us you have to think of,&#8221; the Duchess
seized the opportunity to suggest. &#8220;We hope you
may find a wife who will make your life happy, and
you would not like to go to her with any mark against
your name.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Home Secretary had never spoken of Sir Bernard
Vanbrugh&#8217;s refusal. His repulse had mortified
him deeply, but he took it sedately as he took most
other things. He blamed himself for not having
made sure of Hero in the first place, and with a certain
obstinacy he still clung to the idea that she would
sooner or later be his.</p>

<p>Sir Bernard had been equally silent on his side. He
did not know which way his daughter&#8217;s inclination
went, and wanted to avoid a disagreement.</p>

<p>The Duchess, whose diplomacy was of the simplest
order, went on to say to Alistair:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think you would like to come abroad
for a little time? The Vanbrughs have a house at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
Dinard, and it would be very pleasant if you would
take me over there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair gazed at his mother in doubt. He could
hardly misunderstand her drift, and the light in his
eyes was a sufficient revelation to her of his own
wishes. But the gossip which had reached him concerning
his brother and Hero Vanbrugh held him
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;What about Trent?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t leave town till Parliament rises, of
course. He may join us afterwards, perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair was puzzled by his mother&#8217;s indifferent
tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will he like me to be there in his absence?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>The Duchess was equally puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what difference does it make to him?&#8221; she
returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there something? I thought&mdash;I heard that
he and Miss Vanbrugh&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; she declared with confidence. &#8220;There
has never been any idea of that kind. He likes her
very much as a friend, but he would not think of
anything more. I know exactly what his views are;
he has often told me. He means to marry a great
fortune. Hero will have money, no doubt,&#8221; she was
quick to add. &#8220;Her father is rich for a professional
man, I believe. But, of course, he could not give her
enough for Trent.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>Alistair received the assurance with a throb of
delight, as his mother&#8217;s project suddenly shone out
to him in the bright light of hope. But a misgiving
of another kind assailed him, and one which he found
it more difficult to explain to her. He found himself
ashamed to pass straight from the side of Molly
Finucane to such a girl as Hero Vanbrugh. It would
be almost an insult, he thought; it would be acting
as though he sought Hero, not for her own sake,
but as a sort of refuge, a substitute for the woman he
had left.</p>

<p>The sense of shame which Hero alone had been
able to rouse in him returned in its full force at the
idea of presenting himself before her with all the
stains of his past life still showing, with Molly&#8217;s
kisses fresh upon his lips. He felt a desire to go
away first and purge his life in other scenes, to renew
himself in some atmosphere of sweet and strong endeavour
from which he could hope to emerge fitter
for Hero&#8217;s love.</p>

<p>Alistair wondered that his mother did not perceive
the indelicacy of such a course as she had proposed,
and Caroline on her part wondered at the
strange embarrassment with which Alistair at last
gave his consent to her plans. It was not easy for
these two to understand each other.</p>

<p>During the few days that elapsed before their departure
the Duchess did succeed in getting a glimpse
at what was weighing on Alistair&#8217;s mind. She saw
with secret concern that he really did doubt if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
were worthy of such a girl as Hero, and that this
doubt might even prove an obstacle to the fulfilment
of her desires. It was necessary to encourage him,
and give him confidence in himself, and the conscientious
mother was surprised to find herself in the
strange part of an apologist, extenuating instead of
aggravating her son&#8217;s misdoing. Her first faltering
attempts in this direction brought about a beautiful
change in the whole intercourse between the pair.
Caroline was deeply touched to see how the prodigal
son&#8217;s nature softened and expanded under this rare
indulgence. They began to be happy together; the
poor woman secretly feared that she must be doing
wrong.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Alistair rose on the first morning in their
new home, and stepped out of his bedroom window
on to the little balcony that overlooked the Emerald
Coast, he repeated to himself the two lines of
Keats in which the essence of all poetry is distilled:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Magic casements opening on the foam</div>
<div class="verse">Of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn,&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The house, which had been Hero&#8217;s choice for them,
stood on the far edge of a little headland dividing
a sandy bay from the broad haven of the Rance.
The surrounding sea was ringed with a crescent of
rocks and islets in the midst of which green C&eacute;zembre
glowed&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;The captain jewel in the carcanet.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>Something, that seemed the mast of a wrecked
ship, rose up in melancholy memorial from one seaweed-covered
ledge on which the waves were now
foaming softly, like a child that tries to kiss away
the recollection of its passion. On his right hand,
across the shallow glistening tides of the estuary, the
tall spire of St. Malo lifted itself like a more stately
mast above the white walls of the islet city of the
corsairs. Far to the west the grey cape of Freher
watched the Atlantic billows, like a grim warder of
the Breton coast. And over all the summer haze
lay like a spell of strong imagination, and conjured
up a legendary world.</p>

<p>It was a leaf of poetry that lay outspread before
him, and he read it with a poet&#8217;s eye. The faculty
of toil, the long labour of the midnight lamp, the
fortunate strategy of words, had been denied to Alistair
Stuart, and therefore he was not a poet. Remained
the gift of wonder and of worship, and by
that talisman he still had power to people the sweeping
landscape with mysterious life; the Tritons rose
and called each other from the waves, old Proteus
lifted a slumbering head and listened from his cave,
and on the rocks the Sirens sang.</p>

<p>He had risen in that happy mood when every little
thing becomes a spring of joy. The coffee foaming
in its thick white cup, that woke him with its
fragrance, and the shell-like bread, were delightful
reminders that he had come to a lighter-hearted land.
He dressed himself in pearl-grey flannels, and wandered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
out into the garden with a wide-rimmed panama
over his brows, and drank the scent of roses
and carnations, intoxicated by all the beauty round
him, like a man risen from a sick-bed. His thoughts
went back to the life he had just left, and he wondered
that he could have lived it for so long. All
the dark speculations, the impulses that had moved
him to go down into sheol, seemed to have suddenly
become as unreal as the imaginary dangers of the
night forest are to the traveller coming out on the
broad highway at dawn.</p>

<p>When the Duchess joined him in the garden walk
that overlooked the sea, she gazed on her boy with
secret pride. As he stood there in the sunshine, the
light breeze playing in his hair, and in his eyes the
dawn of joy and hope, he seemed to her mother&#8217;s
heart a Prince Charming who had only to stretch
out his hand and pluck the fairest flower in the garden
of love.</p>

<p>Alistair found himself too much excited to remain
at home waiting for the advent of the Princess. With
a lover&#8217;s superstition he believed that the way to
hasten her coming was to go out himself. He kissed
his mother, and went down a rock-hewn stairway
at the foot of which a wooden gate let him out on
the sands.</p>

<p>The little Plage, enclosed between the two headlands
which Dinard thrusts out into the sea like a
snail&#8217;s horns, was bustling like a fair. The French
had made a miniature village of the beach, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
streets of little huts in which they read, and sewed,
and called upon each other, and carried on their family
life. Children were burrowing in the sand like
rabbits, and bathers clad in the bright hues of butterflies
fluttered on the sea&#8217;s edge.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I might live this life always!&#8221; Alistair murmured,
with a sort of wonder at his own past blundering,
as he stepped among this glad throng, as glad
as they.</p>

<p>Hero came towards him, walking beside her father,
dressed in white with one blue flower at her throat
and a red flower in her heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were just coming to see you!&#8221; she cried gaily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not wait for you, you see!&#8221; cried Alistair.</p>

<p>And they two looked at each other through the
magic casement of love.</p>

<small>NEW LAMPS FOR OLD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the next few days a thing happened that
surprised everyone. Sir Bernard Vanbrugh and Lord
Alistair became great friends.</p>

<p>Alistair had motives that were plain enough to
three members of the little party for his goodwill towards
Hero&#8217;s father. But it puzzled the two women
to account for the pleasure which Sir Bernard evidently
found in the society of the young man.</p>

<p>To the Duchess the development did not bring unmixed
satisfaction. Her own acquaintance with the
scientist had begun with some secret trepidation on
her part. She knew that Vanbrugh held opinions
which she had been accustomed to hear described in
the venomous language of her creed as infidelity, and
which she had been taught to attribute to moral perversity
rather than to mental aberration. Such a
man was not the father-in-law she would have chosen
for her son, though she had resigned herself to the
relationship as an inevitable evil, the flaw inseparable
from all human arrangements. While it pleased her
to see that he liked Alistair, she watched with secret
uneasiness Alistair&#8217;s unaffected liking for him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>To Vanbrugh the young man presented himself as
an intelligent companion, a rare exception among the
crowd of contemporary youths with minds ranging
from bridge to polo, and from horses to ballet-girls.
It could not have occurred to him in any case that
the Duke of Trent&#8217;s brother was a probable aspirant
to the prize which the Duke had failed to gain, and,
in fact, his mind was so thoroughly armed against the
possibility of Lord Alistair as a son-in-law that he
never thought of him in any such connection.</p>

<p>He spoke of him freely to Hero, as he might have
spoken of a character in some play which they had
both seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like that scapegrace because he is so sincere,&#8221;
he confided to her one evening after Stuart had left
them. &#8220;He never seems to have acquired the habit
of hypocrisy. I suppose it is because he has always
had the world at his feet. If he had ever had to
earn his living he would have had to pretend like the
rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vanbrugh&#8217;s brow contracted as he added:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Queen said to me once: &#8216;I like you, Sir
Bernard, because you always tell me the exact truth.&#8217;
I replied to her: &#8216;That is the reason, Madam, why
it has taken me forty years to come into your
presence.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The physician&#8217;s long and stern fight with society,
as represented by his own profession, had qualified
him to sympathize with another Ishmael, though one
of a very different order. His indulgence for Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
Alistair did not spring from any flexibility in his own
standard of conduct; but for the shams of European
morality, for the decorum which consists in keeping
one&#8217;s wife in London, and one&#8217;s concubines in Paris,
he had as strong a contempt as Alistair&#8217;s own. The
proprieties of the cupboard-door were equally loathsome
to both; the hackneyed dance of society, for
ever whirling giddily round on the skirts of the Divorce
Court maelstrom, was equally repellent.</p>

<p>The attitude of the scientist contained an enigma
for Alistair, whose intellect, wavering and searching
like a flame in the wind, contrasted with Vanbrugh&#8217;s
as the strength of fire contrasts with the strength of
steel. To him there appeared something stubborn
and unreasonable in the scientist&#8217;s morality, which
substituted collective Teutonic instinct for the voice
of God. The Haeckelian vision of a world of Unitarian
ministers and their wives leading uniform lives
in a Prussian barrack struck cold on his imagination.
In the new ethics he found the Puritan prison-house
without the window.</p>

<p>There was one difference, however, for which he
could only be grateful. His new friend appeared
to reverse the common practice, and to be strict with
himself only that he might be merciful with others.
His programme did not include the conversion of the
sinner, and for the first time in his life Alistair found
himself associating with a righteous man who did not
want to do him good.</p>

<p>This unique toleration would have refreshed him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
under any other circumstances. But at such a moment,
and in such a quarter, it disconcerted him.
When, with some idea of softening the judgment of
Hero&#8217;s father, Alistair attempted a plea that he had
sown his wild oats, he was taken aback by the answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;The evil is sometimes not in sowing wild oats,
but in sowing tame oats among them. Mixed oatmeal
is good for neither horse nor man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not sure that I understand you,&#8221; Stuart
faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that it is a dangerous idea that the really
diseased can become good members of society. In
my experience a man who tries to change his nature
often changes it for the worse. The reformed drunkard
is apt to become an insane teetotaller, and the
reformed rake makes the worst possible father.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair dared not pursue the subject. He had
some ground for hoping that Sir Bernard&#8217;s practice
might be less inexorable than his principles.</p>

<p>Soon after their meeting, the Duchess, overcoming
her dread of the scientist for Alistair&#8217;s sake, ventured
to ask him what he thought of her boy. Vanbrugh,
with his habitual bluntness, had terrified her by
responding:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he drinks too much. You ought to try
to stop him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor mother had already noticed, and tried
to shut her eyes to, this weakness of Alistair&#8217;s, new
in her experience of him. It was due, she told herself,
to the influence of Molly Finucane, and would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
pass away now that he had escaped from that evil
atmosphere.</p>

<p>Something of this she tried to plead to Sir Bernard.</p>

<p>&#8220;He never used to take too much,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But
he is easily influenced by his companions. He needs
someone to watch over and strengthen him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Even Vanbrugh shrank from speaking his
whole mind about Lord Alistair to the trembling
mother. &#8220;If you can persuade him to stay with you
it may check him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess was afraid to carry her soundings
further. For the first time it dawned upon her that
Sir Bernard was capable of taking a critical view of
such a son-in-law.</p>

<p>She had conveyed the physician&#8217;s judgment to Alistair,
and Alistair had rejoiced her by a promise of
amendment which had so far been kept. To help
him, the Duchess had insisted on sacrificing her own
glass of wine, and as both the Vanbrughs were water-drinkers,
all intoxicants had silently disappeared from
the tables of both households.</p>

<p>Alistair was touched by his mother&#8217;s self-denial
on his behalf, and cheered by Hero&#8217;s delicate sympathy.
In the first flush of his new resolution, amid
the distractions of his changed life, and buoyed up
by the inspiration of his love, the path of reformation
was made smooth for him. The gloomy feelings that
had haunted him in London returned into the remote
recesses of consciousness. The bright constellation of
Ormuzd rose beckoning before him, and the dark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
Sign of the Suffering One sank below the horizon of
life.</p>

<p>The only reminders he had of the past were the
letters that reached him from Molly Finucane.</p>

<p>At first the letters had come every day, passionate,
reproachful, entreating him to return to her. Molly
protested that she had seen no more of Mendes; that
she was selling everything in the house at Chelsea;
that they would still have enough to go on with till
Alistair&#8217;s allowance from his brother became due;
that she would follow him and live with him where
and how he would. When Alistair wrote back what
he intended for a final farewell, and sent a banknote
given him by his mother, Molly returned the note
torn into a dozen pieces. Then the letters became
fewer and more pleading and pitiful. At last there
came one telling him that Molly had taken refuge
with her brother, whose address she gave him, in
some Lambeth slum. After that there were no more
letters. The little woman had sunk in despair.</p>

<p>Alistair tried hard to forget Molly Finucane, and
for a time it seemed to him that he had succeeded.
His love, if the passion she had aroused in him deserved
that name, had died out of itself, his compassion
had been put to sleep by the influences brought
to bear upon him. If these good women, if one so
filled with the spirit of Christian charity as his
mother, could see nothing blameworthy in his desertion
of Molly&mdash;indeed, nothing that was not wholly
praiseworthy&mdash;surely it was absurd for him, the prodigal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
and the bankrupt, the unbeliever and the misanthrope,
to let himself be tormented by misgivings.
To ruin what was left of his own life for the sake
of one whom no human sacrifice could redeem&mdash;surely
this were madness rather than heroism.</p>

<p>In this mood he became a ready listener to the
philosophy of Sir Bernard Vanbrugh; and Sir Bernard
expounded his philosophy with some of that
proselytizing zeal which marked the last generation
of scientists, the Huxleys and the Tyndalls, before
Science had laid down her arms at the feet of the
great Sphynx, and confessed that she had found no
better symbol to replace the old.</p>

<p>It would have surprised and alarmed the Duchess
if she had been told that the topic most frequently
discussed between Sir Bernard Vanbrugh and her son
was religion. It would have more than surprised
her, it would have found her utterly incredulous, if
anyone had told her that Alistair had an intensely
religious nature.</p>

<p>To her unnaturally stunted mind the word &#8220;religion&#8221;
had only one meaning, and unbelief only one
excuse. Alistair had heard the Gospel. In his boyhood
he had shown signs of yielding to its influence;
it followed, therefore, that his later rejection of it
was a deliberate surrender to Satan. Everything in
his troubled life that had resulted from his having
been violently robbed of his own religion she attributed
to his wilful and wicked refusal to embrace
hers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>In reality, ever since the evangelical tutors employed
by the Duchess had succeeded in convincing
Alistair that the Catholic creed was false, without
convincing him that their own creed was true, he had
been groping in a spiritual twilight. The religious
instinct, though wounded and defaced, was not dead.</p>

<p>He still cherished a more kindly feeling for the
Roman Church than for any other, as the one which
he had found most indulgent to the sinner, or, at
all events, most intelligent and tactful in dealing with
himself. To his intellect the language of both creeds
sounded incredible. But whereas the teachers of his
mother&#8217;s confession seemed to share the darkness of
their most ignorant disciples, he had found among
the priests of Rome some whom he could listen to
without impatience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our Church,&#8221; they declared, &#8220;has never claimed
that her formulas should be taken literally like mathematical
propositions. The Catholic word for &#8216;creed&#8217;
is &#8216;symbol.&#8217; We offer our dogma, not as the truth itself,
but as a symbol of the truth&mdash;an allegory, if you
will. It is the best statement of the relations between
the Unseen and man that the human mind is capable
of receiving, and we offer it as nothing more.&#8221;</p>

<p>This comfortable language would have gone far
to satisfy Alistair if he had not observed on the part
of his Catholic friends a certain reticence and subservience
to authority which alarmed his liberty-loving
instincts.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>The answer to his demand for freedom was the
answer of all priesthoods.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a few minds are strong enough to stand
alone. Our Church does not forbid inquiry. She
does not punish freethought. What she forbids and
punishes is the attempt to disturb the ignorant, to
rob them of the faith which is the best for them, without
giving them anything in exchange. You may
persuade the peasant-woman to give up her Christian
Catechism, but you will not persuade her to replace it
by the Synthetical Philosophy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair felt that this was still the old situation.
He was to be silenced lest others might be shocked.
He was to be bound that they might be free&mdash;to suffer
that they might be strong.</p>

<p>While he thus found himself cut off from the communion
of the orthodox, the Christian religion continued
to fascinate him. His spirit felt the presence
of a living truth concealed in these formulas which
his mind could not accommodate, like a beautiful face
hidden beneath an ugly mask.</p>

<p>Sir Bernard Vanbrugh&#8217;s theology was of the new
scientific kind which calls itself anthropology. The
analysis of myths and the genesis of beliefs had
formed his favourite study, outside the range of his
profession, and he found a missionary&#8217;s satisfaction
in imparting his lore to Alistair Stuart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Christianity,&#8221; Vanbrugh proclaimed, &#8220;is a synthesis
of all the ancient beliefs of the Mediterranean,
some of them comparatively enlightened, others purely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
barbarous. We are now able to trace every one
of its rites and dogmas to an origin in some older
state of society. Its evolution has been as entirely
natural as that of man himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is not that rather in its favour than against it?&#8221;
Alistair suggested. &#8220;Is it not possible to view the
primitive beliefs as the gradual unfolding of a great
truth?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vanbrugh frowned. This was not language that
he liked to hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what the orthodox would say, no doubt.
But I am not concerned with apologetics. No serious
thinker will ever again waste his time in controversy
with that class of person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid the orthodox would not think one
view any better than the other,&#8221; replied Alistair,
thinking of his mother. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the orthodox view
that all the resemblances to Christianity found in
other religions are blasphemous parodies contrived by
the devil in order to discredit the true faith?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Bernard smiled, reassured of his pupil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose that is the sound explanation. But
there is a school of reconcilers abroad, men who want
to retain positions in the Church without wholly forfeiting
the respect of educated men, and their favourite
cry just now is the evolution of religion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the religious instinct itself? How do you
account for that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the beginning it was nothing but the savage&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
fear of Nature, as Lucretius observed. In our days
it is an atavistic survival&mdash;practically a disease.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair trembled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it a disease that can be cured?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every disease can be cured as soon as it is understood,
or if not cured in the individual it can be eliminated
in the race. Where religion is due to a mere
obstruction in the brain, we shall in time be able to
remove it by trepanning; but where it is a hysterical
symptom, the only remedy will be to isolate the sufferers,
as we now isolate the insane, and allow them
to die out.&#8221;</p>

<p>A strange light broke on Alistair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is not that what the Catholic Church does?&#8221; he
said eagerly. &#8220;Her monks and nuns&mdash;are they not
really hysterical patients who are voluntarily adopting
the very course that science would prescribe for
them?&#8221;</p>

<p>The scientist grudgingly conceded that this was so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfortunately the convents soon became mere
refuges for the idle,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;And healthy
girls were forced into them by selfish parents in order
to save their dower. Still, no doubt the Protestants
made a mistake in shutting up the monasteries altogether
and condemning celibacy as a vice. There are
plenty of cases in which it ought to be compulsory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why compulsory?&#8221; Alistair pleaded. &#8220;Surely it
is far better that they should take a vow of their own
accord, inspired by the thought that they are helping
to save the race?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>The scientist shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;All that is sentiment,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;one of the things
for which the healthy have no use.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;How monotonous the world will be when everyone
is perfect! You will have to preserve a few
criminals as curiosities, like the lions and tigers in
the Zoological Gardens.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Bernard smiled good-humouredly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t be necessary. We shall preserve some
of the savage tribes instead. They are documents of
priceless value to the anthropologist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When does a man cease to be a priceless document,
and become a criminal?&#8221; Stuart asked, with secret
bitterness.</p>

<p>The other reflected for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose the answer is given by Johnson&#8217;s definition
of dirt: When he is in the wrong place.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the answer which Alistair had given to himself
that night on Westminster Bridge. He was in
the wrong place. But was there any right place in
the world for him?</p>

<p>He lifted his eyes and looked away. They were
sitting on the verandah of Vanbrugh&#8217;s house in the
Malounine, facing eastward. The sun was just leaving
the sky, and the red glow of the western horizon,
caught full on the white walls and windows of St.
Malo, bathed the city in fire. Alistair&#8217;s heart beat
painfully as he strained his eyes on the flaming town.
There was his world, there the vision that called to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
his soul. O, not in dingy lanes, not on the cold, grey
pavements of reality, but amid those vermilion glories,
his spirit should have dwelt and burned itself
away.</p>

<p>He was an exile. Not from the Island of Oig,
nor any other island of an earthly sea, but from that
far-off sphere of which the sunset-smitten town reminded
him. He was an exile from some world of
which love, and not hate, was the keynote, banished
for what fault he could not tell, condemned to mortal
life as to a penance, but tormented and consoled by
intimations from that happier state.</p>

<p>The soul has her imperial moments when she exercises
a prerogative that reason cannot take away;
when the toilsome knowledge gathered together by
the senses falls into shards under her feet, and she
enters into possession of herself, freed from the bonds
and trammels cast about her by the material brain.
In that moment Alistair did not think&mdash;he knew,
knew well, more surely than if a voice from the beyond
had spoken it in his ear, that he was an immortal
spirit inhabiting eternity.</p>

<p>When his attention returned to the voice beside
him, he found that the agnostic was expounding the
folklore of the crucifixion.</p>

<p>&#8220;The whole subject has been illuminated by Dr.
Frazer&#8217;s book &#8216;The Golden Bough,&#8217;&#8221; he was saying.
&#8220;The sacrifice of a human victim in the spring,
at the time of the seed-sowing, is one of the oldest
rites in the world. The victim was originally conceived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
of as the corn-god, and was put to death in
order that his spirit might enter into the seed. His
body was buried in the field, and he was supposed to
rise again in the form of the harvest. In that way
the dogma of Transubstantiation had once a reasonable
meaning&mdash;the bread was the flesh of the slain
god in his new avatar.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair listened like one awakening from sleep who
has not yet caught the sense of what is going on
around him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Christianity, in short, is the old Adonis worship,
adapted according to Jewish ideas. The Old Testament
is full of allusions to this cult&mdash;&#8216;women weeping
for Tammuz,&#8217; and so on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were speaking of a human victim,&#8221; murmured
Alistair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; it was customary to select a man at Easter,
usually in later times a condemned criminal, who was
sacrificed as a scapegoat for the sins of the people.
The Jewish mob appear to have claimed a victim in
accordance with this custom. Two were released, in
fact, one to be sacrificed, and the other to be honoured
as the representative of spring.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair felt there was some confusion in this statement.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the sins of the people,&#8221; he repeated thoughtfully.
&#8220;You say the victim was sacrificed for the sins
of the people?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was one form of the cult,&#8221; the scientist assented.
&#8220;The idea of the sin-bearer is a very ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
superstition. Even the details of the New Testament
narrative follow the lines of what we know to
have been the customary ceremonial in Babylon and
elsewhere. The scourging and the crown of thorns
were both familiar practices. They are alluded to in
Isaiah&mdash;&#8216;He was wounded for our transgressions.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;With his stripes we are healed.&#8217;&#8221; Alistair finished
the sentence with a start of surprise. They were
the words he had tried and failed to remember on the
night of his disgrace.</p>

<p>&#8220;At an earlier stage in the history of the cult the
king of the tribe had been sacrificed,&#8221; Vanbrugh went
on, &#8220;So, when a criminal was substituted, he was
still called the king for the occasion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a fine end for the criminal,&#8221; was Alistair&#8217;s
comment.</p>

<p>His mind presented him with two contrasted pictures&mdash;the
felon of civilization, in his dreadful garb,
numbered and branded like a chattel, drudging in the
stone quarries under the warder&#8217;s eye; and that sufferer
of the antique world, drawn out of some fetid
Eastern gaol, clad in the royal robe and crown, and
marched in solemn priest-led procession to the top
of a Syrian hill to be put to death for the salvation
of the people. The sin-bearer, the redeemer&mdash;surely
every criminal was such! &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see,&#8221; he said
suddenly to the astonished anthropologist, &#8220;that they
were right? They were simply saying what modern
science is saying, only they said it far more beautifully.
The criminal is the sin-bearer; he <i>is</i> crucified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
for the good of the people even to-day. He is imprisoned
and hanged that our lives and purses may
be safe. By his stripes we are healed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Bernard Vanbrugh told his daughter that night
that he was a little disappointed in Lord Alistair.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is brilliant enough in his own way,&#8221; was the
scientist&#8217;s verdict, &#8220;but not practical. I am afraid
he is a dreamer.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the dreamer that Hero loved.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />


<small>A SPOKE IN THE WHEEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> assurance that Hero loved him was not conveyed
to Alistair in words. It stole in upon him like
faint scents rising from the earth after a shower, and
thrilled him almost unawares.</p>

<p>The note of passion was overlaid by higher and
more intricate harmonies. In Hero&#8217;s thoughts of
Alistair there was a protecting tenderness, like a
mother&#8217;s for a child that has suffered some hurt; and
in Alistair&#8217;s thoughts of her there was a reverence
and spiritual yearning that made it seem profane to
offer her the common coin of love.</p>

<p>When he sat beside her on some lonely stretch of
sand or grass-clad promontory, and saw the sea reflected
in her eyes, like the star in the wine-cup of
Hafiz, he shrank instinctively from the thoughts that
other women had roused in him. For the first time
he saw into the mind of the ascetic, and shared its
rebellion against Nature&mdash;Nature that roots the flower
of life in earth. A silence often fell on him in
Hero&#8217;s presence. He dreaded certain stages on the
way in front of them, and wished that they could have
fallen asleep together, and waked up man and wife.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>The marriage of true minds, so rare and so desirable,
made formal marriage vulgar. There was something
impossible in that astounding ceremony by
which society revealed its strain of primitive savagery.
How could a man and woman, sensitive to
beautiful things, their hearts vibrating with the awful
music of creation, prank themselves out like negroes
at a fair, and march into a public building to advertise
mankind of what they were about to do? The
marriage of true minds did not admit impediments
like these.</p>

<p>The thorns of life pressed less roughly against his
spirit as he talked with Hero. He opened his heart
to her, and the bitterness within seemed to be changed
and softened under the tender light of sympathy. A
process of reconciliation went on without his understanding
whither he was being led.</p>

<p>And Hero found in Alistair that which her life had
lacked hitherto&mdash;a motive and an aim. For in the
view of life in which she had been trained there was,
as Alistair told himself, no window; and Hero had
missed the window. She had sought it at St. Jermyn&#8217;s,
and found only the pale altar-lights of a past
age guttering in their sockets. For a brave, truthful
heart like hers that was not enough. In Alistair&#8217;s
discontent, in his revolt against the social order that
had condemned him, she discerned his latent faith
in a more beautiful order, of which this triumphant
one was the enemy.</p>

<p>Her woman&#8217;s instinct told her that every man&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
life depends for one-half of its happiness or its misery
on the women he meets with. The man who has
met the right woman for him cannot be utterly cast
down. And so, as Alistair&#8217;s mother had foreseen,
Hero&#8217;s love was strengthened by the idea of devotion.
She had the power to help this wounded soldier, perhaps
to nurse him back to strength again, and such
a mission was the best thing that life had yet offered
her.</p>

<p>All this became part of their mutual consciousness
as the days stretched into weeks of happy summer,
and Alistair still lingered, in wayward mood, unwilling
to exchange delicious expectation for dull security.
For the poet waking life has nothing that can
quite match the exquisite texture of his dream. And
when at last he spoke he did so rather sorrowfully,
like one who says farewell.</p>

<p>Without having made any compact with each other,
the lovers kept their secret for a time.</p>

<p>Even Alistair&#8217;s mother, though she was watching
and praying for the end, could not feel sure that it
had been reached. But there is one eye keener than
a mother&#8217;s, and that is a rival&#8217;s. The Home Secretary
had read with angry jealousy the letters in which
the Duchess described the growing intimacy between
Alistair and Hero, and innocently indulged her hopeful
anticipations. He sought and obtained the Prime
Minister&#8217;s permission, and on the day that Parliament
was prorogued he left England for France.</p>

<p>Alistair went across to St. Malo to meet the English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
boat, and the moment he saw him the Duke
guessed the truth. The brothers had not been really
cordial for many years, though for their mother&#8217;s
sake both tried to keep up a conventional friendliness.
But on this occasion Alistair greeted his brother
with an unaffected kindliness which sprang from
the new happiness in his heart. He was at peace
with the world; he wished to be at peace with Trent
as well. He wanted to forget past grudges, and to
view his brother&#8217;s character and conduct towards him
in the most favourable light.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so glad you have come, Trent,&#8221; he said
heartily. &#8220;This place is fairyland itself, without the
ogres.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about Sir Bernard Vanbrugh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is quite well. Do you mean, is he an ogre?&#8221;</p>

<p>Trent nodded. He knew something about the
scientist.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not found him very formidable so far,&#8221;
Alistair said cheerfully.</p>

<p>His brother&#8217;s hint had made an impression on him
nevertheless. He had suspected for some time that
it would not be all plain sailing with Sir Bernard
Vanbrugh, and this confirmation of his fears from
another quarter depressed him considerably.</p>

<p>Trent was satisfied. He saw that his brother had
not yet spoken to Hero&#8217;s father, although he might
have spoken to Hero.</p>

<p>The Duchess was waiting at the villa to welcome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
her eldest son. Almost the first thing she said to him
was:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have asked the Vanbrughs to dine here to-night.
I thought you would like to see your old friend
Hero.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I should like to see her,&#8221; the Home Secretary
replied impassively.</p>

<p>The suspicious glance which Alistair darted at him
was met and repelled by the Minister&#8217;s reserve.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if you liked Sir Bernard too,&#8221;
the Duchess added. &#8220;He is an extraordinary man.
He seems to know almost all about everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have met him,&#8221; Trent said, with the same cold
indifference. &#8220;He impressed me as an extremely able
man&mdash;a man of strong character.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess waited till she and Trent were alone
to broach the topic that was engrossing her thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think all is going well,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They seem
quite wrapped up in each other. But I am still a
little anxious about Alistair. The poor boy seems
to be so much ashamed of his disgrace; he has told
me that he does not think he is good enough for a
girl like Hero Vanbrugh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The question is what she thinks, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; that is what I want you to tell him. You
can put it better than I can. A little encouragement
from you just now might turn the scale. We can
save him&mdash;and you will help me, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t said anything to her father, I
suppose?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>&#8220;No.&#8221; The Duchess looked a little troubled. &#8220;He
is not a man I should find it easy to be confidential
with. I think I am a little afraid of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you are right,&#8221; pronounced the rejected
suitor.</p>

<p>All the old bitterness had welled up again as his
mother spoke. He, the eldest son, the credit to the
family, was welcomed by his mother simply as an
ally in the salvation of the young prodigal who had
brought disgrace upon their house. He was to encourage
this ne&#8217;er-do-weel, who at last showed some
slight sense of his own worthlessness&mdash;to pat him on
the back, and bid him go forward and win the bride
whom he, Trent, had been refused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would sound Sir Bernard,&#8221; said the
innocent Duchess.</p>

<p>Trent started. The suggestion chimed in so exactly
with certain dark suggestions of his own secret
mind that he nearly betrayed his exultation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do so if you wish,&#8221; he said, measuring out
his words carefully, so as to give his conscience no
possible excuse thereafter for reproaching him with
treachery to his brother.</p>

<p>The Vanbrughs had not been in the house five minutes
that night before the Duke saw more than anyone
else had seen. Every look that passed across the
table between Alistair and Hero told him that they
had nothing more to tell each other. He saw also
that the physician had as little suspicion of what had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
happened as if he had been a thousand miles off all
the time.</p>

<p>After dinner was over the lovers wandered down
the garden paths and the Duchess retired to her drawing-room.
The Duke and Vanbrugh were left sitting
on the verandah over the coffee and cigars, of
which only Trent partook. The physician dealt as
severely with himself as with his patients, and the
abstemious habits so long enforced by poverty had not
been departed from in prosperity.</p>

<p>The Home Secretary considered how he could
make his attack most crushing. An ingenious idea
suggested itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you have treated me quite fairly,
Sir Bernard?&#8221; he asked in an accent of mild reproach.</p>

<p>The physician turned and stared at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;In what way do you mean, Duke?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I not correct in saying that you declined me
for a son-in-law principally on the ground that I had
the misfortune to be the brother of Lord Alistair
Stuart?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was one of my strongest reasons, certainly&mdash;perhaps
the strongest. Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke waved his hand in the direction in which
the lovers had disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never said anything implying that I should object
to make a friend of your brother,&#8221; protested Sir
Bernard hastily, trying to ward off the unwelcome
suggestion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>The Minister treated this evasion with contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;My brother has been wiser than I, it appears. He
has made sure of Miss Vanbrugh&#8217;s consent before
asking for yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you are mistaken!&#8221; cried the father, now
seriously alarmed. &#8220;I am sure you must be. I know
every thought in my daughter&#8217;s mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it possible that you, a wise man, can believe
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am certain that she has never had a secret from
me before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it is serious indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The justice of the remark silenced Vanbrugh. He
struggled in vain to resist the conviction that the
Duke of Trent was right. A hundred trifling indications
of the understanding between the lovers returned
upon his mind, like water pouring in through
a leak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn the young blackguard!&#8221; he growled. &#8220;He
is just the sort that attracts good women. They think
that they can &#8216;save&#8217; him. I ought to have remembered
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trent listened, anxious for some assurance that his
warning would not be thrown away.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I have made a mistake in speaking to you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
He spoke slowly, to let the other interrupt him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You could not have done me a greater service,
Duke. Even if you are mistaken in thinking there
is anything in it, I shan&#8217;t be the less obliged to you
for the warning.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>&#8220;I should not like Miss Vanbrugh or my brother
to know that I had interfered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one shall know. It is a matter entirely between
ourselves.&#8221; The Home Secretary breathed
easily again. &#8220;After all, it was a mere accident. You
naturally thought I had seen as much as you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I spoke under the influence of jealousy,&#8221;
Trent said, determined to do the handsome
thing by his conscience, now that all was safe. &#8220;My
mother had actually asked me to sound you as to the
match.&#8221;</p>

<p>The word stung Sir Bernard.</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be no match,&#8221; he said decisively. &#8220;I
will see to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Trent was satisfied.</p>

<p>When the Vanbrughs were leaving, an hour later,
Sir Bernard declined, a little curtly, Lord Alistair&#8217;s
offer to walk round with them. He watched the
parting between Hero and Alistair, and made up his
mind that he must interfere at once.</p>

<p>In order to give greater weight to his action he
formally told his daughter before going to bed that
he desired to speak to her before she went out the
next morning. Hero&#8217;s start and blush at the request
showed that she guessed its meaning.</p>

<p>The boast which the scientist had made, that he
knew every thought in his daughter&#8217;s mind, might
have been made with more truth by Hero about her
father. She had never deluded herself about the
view which he would take of such a suitor as Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
Alistair Stuart. Now she spent a restless night revolving
in her mind how best to defend the man
she loved.</p>

<p>Sir Bernard passed a restless night also. The task
of a father whose daughter is motherless is a responsible
and delicate one; and though the physician had
accustomed himself to speak more plainly to Hero
than most fathers speak to their daughters, he would
have given a great deal to have had a woman&#8217;s aid
at this crisis.</p>

<p>Their conversation took place the next morning in
the drawing-room of the villa. The scientist missed
his study, but the French seaside house is built on
the principle of parsimony in living-rooms and extravagance
in bedrooms. The villa contained sleeping
accommodation for upwards of twenty persons
and a dining-room comfortably seating six.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have seen a great deal lately of Lord Alistair,&#8221;
the father began gravely, &#8220;and I am afraid
I have been to blame in not noticing how much you
and he were together. I will not ask you whether
you have seen his evident admiration for you, but
I hope it is not too late to caution you against any
serious inclination for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who has been speaking to you about us?&#8221; demanded
Hero, with a bright spot on her cheeks.</p>

<p>Sir Bernard had not allowed for womanly intuition
when he promised to keep the Duke&#8217;s interference
a secret.</p>

<p>He shook his head gravely as he answered:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>&#8220;I see no good in discussing that. It is for you
to tell me how matters stand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the Duke, of course,&#8221; Hero returned.
&#8220;Paragons are always mean. There was a time when
I might have accepted him if he had asked me to.
But he is like the dog in the manger: he would
not ask me himself, and yet he grudges me to
his brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scientist was weak enough to accept the gambit
offered by his adversary.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are doing the Duke an injustice,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;As a matter of fact he called on me some time ago
in London, and asked me for your hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hero opened her eyes. It was a shock, and it
could not be a disagreeable one, to know that she
had had such a suitor. In the light of this revelation
the tale-bearer was less harshly judged.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you say to him? Why didn&#8217;t you tell
me?&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I declined his proposal on medical grounds,&#8221; her
father answered. &#8220;The family stock is unsound.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hero began to see what she had to face, and her
heart sank.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you might have told me,&#8221; she said
reproachfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;He came to ask my consent, not yours, and I told
him I would not give it. There was no reason that
I could see for telling you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hero looked her father in the face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>&#8220;Suppose he had come to me first, and I had accepted
him?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>The physician answered gravely:</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have had to ask you to choose between
him and me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The clash of these two strong wills had come at
last, and both were silent for a time.</p>

<p>Vanbrugh was the first to resume.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every objection I had against the Duke of Trent,
of course, applies with ten-fold force to his brother.
The Duke is physically sound; he has personally escaped
the taint of his family stock, and it is possible
that it may disappear in his descendants. But Lord
Alistair has inherited his father&#8217;s vices. He is an
idler, a profligate, and I might say a drunkard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has ceased to drink,&#8221; Hero protested. &#8220;I do
not believe the life he has been leading is his natural
one. I am sure that if he were to marry a woman
who understood him he would become a changed
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not believe in changed men,&#8221; her father answered.
&#8220;But that is not the point. I am not condemning
Lord Alistair for the life he has led up to
the present. On the contrary, from my point of view
of an enlightened sociology, the sooner such a man
exhausts his vital energy the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would have him commit suicide!&#8221; Hero exclaimed,
with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would have him commit suicide rather than
marry, yes,&#8221; the scientist responded firmly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>&#8220;I have promised to marry him.&#8221; Hero said the
words with a calmness which alarmed her father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even if such a man could reform his conduct, he
could not reform his physical constitution,&#8221; the physician
said, turning his eyes away from his daughter&#8217;s
face. &#8220;His children would be doomed, before their
birth, to disease and insanity. To bring such beings
into the world is a crime worse than murder, and
will be dealt with as such as soon as society has escaped
from the thraldom of the priests.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not the first time that Hero had heard her
father express similar sentiments. It was the personal
application that was new&mdash;and terrifying.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I do not marry Alistair I shall never marry
anyone else,&#8221; she said, after a tragic pause.</p>

<p>Sir Bernard glanced at her face, and saw it pale
with resolution. He became afraid.</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be a crime on your part. It is the
duty of the sound to marry, as much as it is the duty
of the unsound to refrain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Duty to whom?&#8221; asked Hero.</p>

<p>The question opened Vanbrugh&#8217;s eyes to the gulf
that had come into existence during the past few
weeks between him and his daughter. Hitherto Hero
had been his child, and had looked at the world
through his eyes. Now she loved another better than
him, and had learned to look at the world through
the eyes of the man she loved.</p>

<p>His answer was given without confidence.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>&#8220;To society. To the order of Nature of which
you are a part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Society!&#8221; Hero&#8217;s tone breathed some of that
scorn which she had caught from Alistair in their
intimate communion with one another. &#8220;Society!
that is the man in the street, isn&#8217;t it? Or is it the
public?&mdash;the British public expects every man to do
his duty!&#8221; Some of the bitter expressions that she
had heard Alistair use came back to her with unexpected
force, and half unconsciously she defended him
in his own language. &#8220;The whole duty of man is
to be one of a horde of drudges toiling to make a
millionaire. That is civilization, isn&#8217;t it?&mdash;the social
order to which we are all expected to conform. And
the new religion is that we are to marry and have
healthy children, that this great organized stupidity
may go on for ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Bernard Vanbrugh recognized Lord Alistair&#8217;s
voice, and bowed his head in despair. &#8220;My daughter
is lost to me,&#8221; he told himself. &#8220;I have lost my
daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aloud he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;And your father? I have tried to be a good
father to you, my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hero was smitten to the heart. She went over to
where her father sat, and put an arm round his neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love you just the same,&#8221; was all she found it in
her heart to say. &#8220;I love you just the same.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />


<small>THE LAST WORD OF SCIENCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Bernard Vanbrugh</span> knew that he had failed
to shake his daughter&#8217;s resolution.</p>

<p>He did not believe that Hero would marry Lord
Alistair Stuart while he forbade her to. But what
he feared was that she would refuse to give him up.
He was getting on in years, he had not spared himself,
and sooner or later Hero must be free. In the
meanwhile he saw before him the prospect of her
celibacy, a state abhorrent to his feelings whether as
father or as physician.</p>

<p>In his own mind he had a husband chosen for Hero&mdash;an
engineer; one of that class to whom the future
seems to be assigned; sane, strong, and self-reliant;
a water-drinker, like himself; a man of orderly life
and wholesome instincts; an ideal father, for whom
what science calls the mechanism of life was really
mechanism, and nothing more; a man in whose eyes
poetry-books and prayer-books were alike contemptible;
one who found no weakness in himself, and tolerated
none in others.</p>

<p>Vanbrugh compared the husband whom he had
chosen for his daughter with the husband she had
chosen for herself, and was bewildered and impatient.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>In those days a certain obscure writer of Jewish
blood, who had tried, and failed, to write poems,
plays, and novels, had taken vengeance on his more
successful brethren by publishing a malignant libel in
which he pried with some pruriency into their private
lives, and proved for his own consolation that genius
is a form of vice, if not a positive crime. Some
scraps of scientific language picked out of the works
of Professor Lombroso had served to disguise the
critic&#8217;s rancour, and the mixture had proved more
palatable to the public than the author&#8217;s literary efforts.
The sentiment coarsely vented in this work
was that which inspired Sir Bernard Vanbrugh when
he thought of Lord Alistair as a husband for his
only child.</p>

<p>From the envy and more or less feigned Pharisaism
of the libeller Vanbrugh&#8217;s mind, of course, was free.
He had liked Lord Alistair, and been interested by
him. In the life that he had led hitherto he had been
harmless in the scientist&#8217;s view, or, at all events, not
harmful enough to call for harsh measures. But now
everything was changed. If by the lifting of a finger
Sir Bernard could have terminated the young man&#8217;s
existence, and with it the spell which he had flung
over Hero, he would have lifted the finger without
an instant&#8217;s hesitation or an instant&#8217;s remorse.</p>

<p>And yet he judged better of Lord Alistair than
of some of those splendid types of healthy manhood
whom the modern world goes forth to worship, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
they practise foul play against each other for a few
pounds upon the football field. For he decided to
appeal from Hero to her betrothed. He was going
to ask the young man to give up voluntarily the prize
within his grasp; and somehow he did not think that
he should ask in vain.</p>

<p>He left the house about the time Lord Alistair
usually came round, and met him strolling up the
road.</p>

<p>&#8220;My daughter is at home,&#8221; he said, in answer to
Stuart&#8217;s inquiry. &#8220;But before you see her I should
like to speak to you. Is there anywhere where we
can go and have a quiet talk?&#8221;</p>

<p>The request was ominous enough in itself, and the
physician&#8217;s manner made it more so. Alistair&#8217;s heart
sank as he answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect the club would be the best place. We
should not find anyone in the card-room at this hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned and walked silently side by side with
the arbiter of his happiness, past the crowd that bustled
in front of the Plage, and up the short street
that conducted them to the club door.</p>

<p>As he went a great despondency settled on him.
Without knowing what Sir Bernard meant to say to
him, he felt that there was little that he could say for
himself. What account of himself could he give that
would be considered satisfactory by the father of an
only daughter? It was only his mother who had
encouraged him to lift his eyes to Hero. He ought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
to have asked his mother to plead his cause with
Hero&#8217;s father.</p>

<p>Even in his most buoyant moments during the past
few weeks he had never felt quite sure of his happiness.
A sense of unreality came upon him ever and
anon; he had felt like a man dreaming a delicious
dream, and dreading the awakening he knows must
come.</p>

<p>Now the awakening had come, and could not be
put off.</p>

<p>He found himself seated in the deserted card-room
facing Hero&#8217;s father across a small green table, on
which two packs of used cards and three or four
scoring-blocks awaited the return of the bridge-players.</p>

<p>The sight of the soiled packs affected him painfully.
He knew that this economy was due to the exorbitant
French tax, but yet it struck upon him as a note of
squalor. The cards themselves were small and badly
made, like most things made by Governments. He
drew one of the packs towards him, and began shuffling
it nervously while he waited for Vanbrugh to
speak.</p>

<p>Vanbrugh noted the action with a physician&#8217;s eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect you have guessed what I want to speak
to you about,&#8221; he said quietly.</p>

<p>Alistair lifted his eyes from the cards and stole
a glance at his questioner, a glance not free from the
cunning of his Pictish blood. But he said nothing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>&#8220;My daughter tells me that you have asked her to
become your wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Alistair made no response. Keeping
his head down he cut four cards in rapid succession&mdash;a
club, a spade, a diamond, and then another
diamond. He took it as a bad omen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has she told you anything more?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only that she had given you her consent.&#8221; Vanbrugh
hesitated; he found it harder than he had expected
to tell this young man the truth about himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will understand naturally,&#8221; he began again,
&#8220;that Hero is my chief interest in life. Her happiness
is dearer to me than anything else in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And to me, too,&#8221; Alistair put in swiftly, raising
his head and looking Sir Bernard in the face.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what I hoped you would say,&#8221; Sir Bernard
answered gravely. &#8220;I want to discuss the matter
with you from that point of view.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair lowered his head again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not good enough for her&mdash;you need not tell
me that. But if she loves me?&#8221; He spoke in low
tones, which only just reached the father&#8217;s ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must let me speak plainly, Lord Alistair, as
plainly as I spoke to your brother when he came to
me with the same request.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trent! Did he come to you on my behalf?&#8221; cried
Alistair in astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;He came on his own. He has known Hero longer
than you have.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>It took Alistair a moment or two to grasp the
situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you refuse Trent?&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; In his own mind Vanbrugh was beginning
to doubt the wisdom of that refusal. Had he not
been over cautious? His objection to the Duke of
Trent had been more or less hypothetical: the Duke
himself was sound; it was possible that he might not
transmit the family taint. He might have done well
to consider the danger of leaving his daughter to
follow her own fancy. When there were so few perfect
husbands, and so many undesirables, it would
have been wiser, perhaps, to close with one who had
so much in his favour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, in the name of Heaven, did you object to
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Partly because he was your brother. I told him
I could not let my daughter marry a man of diseased
stock.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words stunned Alistair. He had been prepared
to have his own misdeeds brought up against
him; to be told, perhaps, that it was too late for him
to reform; or at least that he must give proofs that
the reformation was thorough and lasting, before he
could be trusted with Hero. But this was cutting
away the very foundations.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heard of such a thing!&#8221; he stammered,
letting the cards fall from his fingers. &#8220;Do you condemn
us for the sins of our ancestors?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>&#8220;It is not I who condemn you. Nature does that,
and I am only her student and interpreter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair put his hand to his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;And is that the latest gospel of science?&#8221; he said
bitterly. &#8220;The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and
the children&#8217;s teeth are set on edge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not a very recent gospel, and you are not
quoting from a scientific work,&#8221; Sir Bernard reminded
him. &#8220;All that science does is to add the corollary
that those who have eaten sour grapes ought not to
become fathers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair made no answer for a time. He sat toying
with the cards, cutting them at random and speculating
vaguely as to who were the Argine and the
Hogier after whom certain picture cards were named.
It struck him that men were like cards; the gods must
have created them of different values for their own
amusement, and be playing some Olympian game
among themselves, in the chances of which it was his,
Alistair&#8217;s, destiny to fall a loser of the trick.</p>

<p>Sir Bernard watched him with a pity he did not try
to quench. He liked this young man very much&mdash;so
much that he could have wished for his sake that
Nature was less inexorable.</p>

<p>&#8220;How merciless science is!&#8221; Alistair observed
presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Science is not so merciless as the old religion,&#8221; the
scientist was not sorry to respond. &#8220;At least, it does
not reproach you for what you cannot help. Its
sentence is not pronounced vindictively, like a bad-tempered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
judge denouncing crimes which he himself
was never tempted to commit. And when it forbids
you to pass on your evil inheritance to the unborn, it
is acting, not without mercy for you, but with greater
mercy for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, while Alistair remained quiet, listening
dully without the power of resistance, the other went
on to draw the picture of tainted life passing from
generation to generation, the terrible theme of the
dramatists from &AElig;schylus to Ibsen, figured by superstition
as a curse from the gods, traced by science
to the cruel thoughtlessness of men. He described
the great army of the victims, as he himself had reviewed
it in his medical practice. In addition to those
whose misfortunes were the subject of public notice
and public charity, there were the innumerable secret
sufferers, the cause and meaning of whose sufferings
was most often unknown to themselves. There were
the drunkards, the gamblers, the adulterers, with
whom the world dealt so much more harshly than
with its cripples and consumptives. There were the
neuropaths and hysterical subjects, little better than
maniacs, yet struggling to keep their place among the
sane, endowed with the gift of reason, held responsible
as reasonable beings, and yet tortured with the
consciousness that their infirmity betrayed them at
every moment into conduct which only madness could
excuse. He touched on the terrible case of those who
go through life with the dark shadow of paralysis
hanging over them, never knowing at what day or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
hour it will strike them down. And all these evils,
and the lesser ones, as they are called, though it may
be doubted if they are really lesser, the infirmities
of temper, of idleness, of defective memory&mdash;in short,
every human frailty and affliction, except the insignificant
damage of war and accident and pestilence&mdash;truly
insignificant in comparison&mdash;he traced to the one
cause. And in a world of healthy, rational men there
would be no war and no pestilence, and very few accidents.
So that true religion and true science, the
religion of Humanity and the science of Nature, were
at one in denouncing as the greatest of all crimes&mdash;indeed,
the only real crime&mdash;the bringing of unhealthy
children into the world.</p>

<p>When he had finished the listener gave him a questioning
look.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if there are no children?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vanbrugh frowned for the first time, and his voice
hardened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have lived a hard and abstemious life,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;I have been stricter with myself than with anyone
else. My reward is to have a child in whom I have
never detected a weak spot. I have a right that she
shall make a happy marriage, and receive a woman&#8217;s
crown of honour&mdash;a happy motherhood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair bowed his head again, and scattered the
cards from his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is to become of me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The mournful question deeply moved Sir Bernard.
He was asking this young man to surrender the sweetest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
form of earthly happiness; what could he offer him
in exchange?</p>

<p>&#8220;Has science nothing else to say to me? You are
a physician; if I am diseased, cannot you cure me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vanbrugh was disconcerted.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are only groping our way as yet,&#8221; he answered
mildly. &#8220;Remember that all knowledge was forbidden
by the priesthood for a thousand years. We
are only in the beginning of a better age.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The age in which there will be no men like me!&#8221;
Alistair commented. &#8220;And in the meantime science
has no gospel for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is your father whom you have to blame,&#8221; Sir
Bernard said reluctantly.</p>

<p>Alistair trembled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that I ought not to have been born?&#8221;</p>

<p>The physician was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a waste product, for which science has no
use. O, why not? You have found beautiful dyes
in coal-tar; can you find nothing in me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vanbrugh was a father fighting for his child, a
zealot fighting for his faith. But he was touched by
this appeal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not said that. I have only told you that
you ought not to become a father. It is not your fault
if you have received an evil inheritance, but it will be
your fault if you pass it on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair hid his face in his hands for a time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be honest with me, Sir Bernard,&#8221; he said presently,
in a husky voice, without lifting his head. &#8220;You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
are the priest of science, and I am in the confessional.
You think I ought to commit suicide?&#8221;</p>

<p>The scientist was profoundly moved. He held his
breath for an instant, and his forehead grew damp.
He found his resolution failing him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, in faltering tones&mdash;&#8220;no, don&#8217;t think
that. I have told you science is still groping her
way. I believe it would be happier for some of the
poor victims of heredity&mdash;the hopelessly insane, the
deaf and dumb, and perhaps the criminal and paralytic&mdash;if
a painless death were provided for them.
But a man with your gifts should find something
worth living for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair looked at him earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to live,&#8221; he said simply. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to
die. I can&#8217;t feel that I have any less right to live
than you. Perhaps the criminals and paralytics can&#8217;t
feel that either. I never feel unfit; I never knew that
there was anything wrong about me till other people
told me so. When I was a boy the world was a beautiful
place to me; it would be so still if there were
no good people in it. It is they who will not let me
live. You are only saying to me in more honest language
what they have been saying to me, what my
own mother has been saying to me, ever since I can
remember. I don&#8217;t know why I am condemned. Ever
since I was a boy I have loved beautiful things as
other men love gold; I have walked through life with
my eyes fixed on the stars, and my feet tripped up
by every ditch. My mother thinks that I am wicked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
and you say that I am diseased. And to me&mdash;yes,
to me&mdash;you all seem blind people burrowing in the
earth and refusing to be happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vanbrugh shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not responsible for what others have said
to you. In my eyes you are simply a victim of heredity.
I do not want my daughter&#8217;s children to be victims
in their turn; that is all. If you love her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do love her,&#8221; Alistair interrupted fiercely. &#8220;I
thought you understood. I only want now to know
what I can do for her sake. If I were a Catholic, I
would go into a monastery, so as to leave her free.
That is the last word of Christianity for a man like
me. The last word of science is the lethal chamber.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Bernard had an inspiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go back to Molly Finucane?&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair fell back in his chair as if he had received
a blow. He woke out of his dream. Sir Bernard
was right, and his mother had been wrong. He had
no business to unite his wrecked career with such a
life as Hero Vanbrugh&#8217;s. Molly Finucane was the
true match for him. She was a scapegoat like himself.
The figure of the poor little painted creature
had haunted his memory even during these last days
of courtship, and he had never felt quite satisfied that
he had acted honourably in leaving her.</p>

<p>He rose to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I can do that. That will set Hero
free. Good-bye, Sir Bernard. I am going back to
London to marry Molly Finucane.&#8221;</p>

<small>POETS&#8217; CORNER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> September sun was shining on Beers Cooperage,
shining as brightly on the dingy London yard as
on the glittering emerald seas of France.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the Cooperage were rejoicing
in the light and warmth. The cripple had brought
out a rocking-chair, with its cane seat patched up
with string, and was swinging himself with half-shut
eyes in front of the little row of flowers which assiduous
watering had kept alive during the summer
drouth. A new canary in the mended cage of its predecessor
chirruped gaily from the open window of
one of the tiny row of cottages; the window of another
revealed a trophy of travel, a box bearing on
its lid a photograph of Southend Pier, framed in polished
mussel-shells, which its owner, with an altruism
not often found in the denizens of lordlier neighbourhoods,
had disposed so that its beauty could be
enjoyed by the passer-by at the expense of the inmates
of the house themselves.</p>

<p>Over the whole of the Cooperage there was an
atmosphere of freshness and content. The little gates
and palings on the window-sills were newly painted in
artistic green and white. Many of them now revealed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
their inner utility by guarding pots of musk
or mignonette, with here and there a bright red geranium.
The pavement of the yard was clean beyond
its former wont, and the refuse heap that had once
marked the abode of Mike Finigan had disappeared.</p>

<p>It was over Mike Finigan&#8217;s house that the greatest
change of all had come. Not a single broken window
was any longer to be seen in the front of the dwelling.
The door had been painted green to match the five-barred
gates, and decorated with a handsome old
brass knocker that shone like an imitation sun. The
window of the ground-floor was open, and through
it could be seen a perfectly &aelig;sthetic kitchen&mdash;a kitchen
after the heart of South Kensington, with a high-backed
settle, a Cromwellian table and armchairs, all
of the finest black oak, a dresser lined with willow-pattern
plates of deepest blue, and a mantelshelf glorious
with copper saucepans scoured to the grain.</p>

<p>The transformation had extended to, or rather it
had begun with, the inhabitants of the regenerated
hovel. The bewildered dwellers in the Cooperage
dated their present era of peacefulness and brightness
from the appearance of a remarkable announcement
in the <i>Times</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;On Monday, the 14th instant, at the registry office, Lambeth,
Lord Alistair Fingal Stuart Campbell-Stuart, brother of the Duke
of Trent and Colonsay, to Miss Molly Finucane, daughter of the
late Jeremiah Finucane, of Beers Cooperage, Lambeth, S. W.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Following on the step thus disclosed to the world
Lord and Lady Alistair had taken up their residence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
in what might have been described with truthfulness
as the home of her ladyship&#8217;s family, vacated beforehand
by her brother.</p>

<p>Stuart had not attempted to reform Mike Finigan.
He had adopted the easier and simpler plan of reforming
Mike Finigan&#8217;s surroundings by obtaining
him a post as water-bailiff to a friend who rented
some fishing in the heart of the Finigan country.
Mike was now living his natural life among his own
people, breaking their heads and getting his own
broken to their mutual contentment, and earning the
character of the best water-bailiff in green Connacht.</p>

<p>Alistair would have been glad to adjust his own
life as successfully as he had adjusted his brother-in-law&#8217;s.</p>

<p>In the first flush of her joy at his return, and gratitude
for the rank he had given her, he had found it
easy to persuade Molly to try the experiment of life
in Beers Cooperage. He allowed the little woman
to consider the scheme as a sort of practical joke, one
of those slaps in the face to the hated middle class
which she had learned to relish as a proof of aristocratic
feeling.</p>

<p>To their humble neighbours the invasion of such
a spot as the Cooperage by such a figure as Lord
Alistair&mdash;Mr. Stuart, he called himself to them&mdash;could
only be understood in the light of those settlements
and missions by which the well-disposed had
recently striven to irradiate the gloom of darkest
London. One of the great public schools had planted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
a hall in adjacent Battersea, the Wesleyans had a settlement
somewhere Walworth way, the Church of
England was bestirring itself in Southwark. The
Cooperites were convinced that the new resident had
come amongst them on evangelizing thoughts intent.
They accepted the green paint and the flowers as a
preliminary sop, and awaited with stolid resignation
the tracts and the lectures on wireless telegraphy and
the Andaman Islands that would surely follow.</p>

<p>Alistair himself was surprised to find how little
was changed in his life by the transmigration. The
brief episode which lay behind him at Dinard took
its place as a dream from which he had awakened.
Respectable society, as represented by the Secretary
of State for the Home Department, had dropped him
once more, and his old friends had welcomed him
back. The marriage announcement had been hailed
in the circle of which he was the acknowledged chief
as a masterpiece, reflecting more glory on him even
than the bankruptcy which was now formally complete.
If Alistair Stuart had gone under he had
proved himself, like Samson, most formidable to the
Philistines in his end.</p>

<p>He was able to estimate the greatness of his triumph
when he found that his first visitor was the
Chevalier Vane.</p>

<p>It was true that the Chevalier came as to the house
of mourning, to condole and patronize rather than
to congratulate, but Stuart knew him well enough
to be sure that he would not have come at all unless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
he considered that there was still some distinction
to be drawn from the association.</p>

<p>Vane&#8217;s restless vanity had just stimulated him to
make a bid for notoriety on his own account, on lines
more congenial to his cautious temper. Inspired by
the example of certain distinguished writers of the
French decadent school who had exchanged the Bacchic
ivy for the Christian palm with evident benefit
to their reputations, he had conceived the felicitous
idea of publicly entering the Church of Rome. He
had already in the press a volume of hymns composed
in honour of various medieval saints, collectively entitled
&#8220;A Rosary of Twilight,&#8221; and he trusted that the
contrast between its mystic piety and the erotic breathings
of his unregenerate muse would at last stir the
reviewers out of their apathy.</p>

<p>He had cherished the hope that a man of his importance
would be deemed a proper subject for conversion
by a Bishop. But the Roman authorities had
taken, as usual, a severely practical view of the situation,
and had intimated that the reception of a convert,
however illustrious, was a matter to be regulated,
like other ecclesiastical ceremonies, by the mundane
consideration of fees. The cost of an episcopal
welcome proved too severe a wrench for the mercenary
instincts of the poet, but after a good deal of haggling
he secured a monsignor, whose violet stockings
made the function a moderate success in the dearth
of by-elections and divorce suits.</p>

<p>Wickham Vane, after a severe internal struggle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
revolted on this occasion from his allegiance, and
struck out a line of his own by embracing the tenets
of the Theosophists. But the two brothers continued
to live together in the same harmony as before, and
it was remarkable that the priests who came from
time to time to confirm the new Catholic in his faith
found Wickham a much more interested listener,
while the yogis and mahatmas who visited Wickham
went away under the firm impression that it was his
brother who was their disciple.</p>

<p>The author of &#8220;A Rosary of Twilight&#8221; brought
with him a presentation copy as an inexpensive form
of wedding-present. Molly received it with gratification
as a homage offered to her in the serious character
of a Christian matron. But the page containing
the inscription to Lord and Lady Alistair was the
one that she read with most pleasure; indeed, it was
the only one that she could understand.</p>

<p>Her promotion had not wrought much change in
Molly&#8217;s manners; there was no reason why it should,
having regard to the tone of the most fashionable
circles; but it had infused a distinct shade of condescension
into her treatment of such of her acquaintance
as were commoners. To the Chevalier Vane
she accorded the courtesy due to his rank, but the untitled
Wickham found himself almost snubbed.</p>

<p>Stuart showed the brothers over his new dwelling.
The front-door opened directly into the art kitchen,
behind which there was a tiny wash-house, where
real cooking could be accomplished on a gas-stove.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
Lady Alistair volunteered the information that they
usually dined out, and that the household work was
attended to by a plebeian neighbour. Overhead there
were two small bedrooms, one of which Alistair had
had fitted up as a dressing-room and study for
himself.</p>

<p>The Vanes were charmed with the whole establishment,
Egerton merely advising a cuckoo clock for the
foot of the stairs as a finishing touch, and Wickham
inclining to think old tapestry more suitable than wallpapers
for the rooms upstairs. In his enthusiasm the
Chevalier even expressed himself as seriously disposed
to install himself in the house adjoining.</p>

<p>&#8220;We might set a fashion,&#8221; he declared, with that
na&iuml;ve vanity by which Alistair hardly knew whether
he was more amused or annoyed. &#8220;In time we might
draw other men of letters round us, and have the
whole court occupied.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it would have to be called Poet&#8217;s Corner,&#8221;
Alistair observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just what I was going to say,&#8221; Vane
snapped back, becoming almost rude in his greediness
to appropriate the suggestion. &#8220;Such a settlement
would be like a lighthouse of civilization.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not,&#8221; Stuart retorted. &#8220;We have had too
many attempts to civilize the slums. I have come
here to barbarize them.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time the Chevalier was compelled to acknowledge
the master&#8217;s superiority.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; he heroically confessed. &#8220;But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
I am certain my idea is a good one. It will make a
sensation. We shall have pilgrims coming to visit
us from all parts of Europe and America.&#8221;</p>

<p>And already in his egoistic fancy he pictured himself
receiving a stream of reporters in his own cottage,
seated in state in some exotic garb, and dictating
interviews on the subject of the poetry of the
Catholic renascence, which would be wired to the
ends of the earth.</p>

<p>Stuart read his thoughts, and smiled rather sadly.
Vane&#8217;s proposal had pleased him at first, corresponding
as it did more or less with the project dimly shaping
in his own mind. He had always had a soft corner
in his heart for the two brothers. He knew
his own need of intellectual fellowship, and both the
Vanes, under their absurd affectations, possessed some
real taste. Egerton could be a pleasant enough companion
on those too rare occasions when he was not
iterating the tedious personal note, and Wickham
shone as a mildly agreeable moon. Stuart was not
blind to their faults, but, then, no master has ever
found faultless disciples. If the disciple were equal
to the master there would be no masterhood.</p>

<p>As it is natural for a leader to crave for followers,
so it is natural that he should bear much from those
who seem disposed to follow him. Stuart, without
analyzing his motives, had made many efforts to attach
the Vanes to himself. He had tried to melt the
adamantine selfishness of the elder by generous praise
of all in him that was possible to praise. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
tried to fan what little sparks of individuality he had
detected in the younger. He had shut his eyes as
much as he could to their humiliating vanity and
meanness, vices which he hoped might exhale in the
sunshine of a little success.</p>

<p>Now he was moved to despair of them. It was
evident that the real attraction for Egerton in the
project he had embraced so feverishly was not the
companionship of congenial minds, but the notoriety
conferred by reporters. His soul thirsted not after
the praise of the judicious, but after the paragraphs
of Fleet Street. Regretfully Alistair made up his
mind to abandon the half-formed scheme, unless the
two brothers could be persuaded to abandon him.
The participation of such a man as Egerton Vane
would degrade any movement in which he played
a part to the level of his own vanity. It did not deserve
even to be called vanity&mdash;it was vulgarity. Instead
of the vanity of genius, it was the vulgarity of
the charlatan.</p>

<p>Happily unconscious of the reflections passing
through Lord Alistair&#8217;s mind, the Chevalier Vane
was occupying his mind with the problem of his neglected
volume, which Lady Alistair had laid aside.
The poet of the Catholic renascence was anxious to
read some of his work to the company, unworthy
though they seemed to feel themselves of such a privilege,
and he began forcibly turning the conversation
towards the end in view.</p>

<p>&#8220;The new poetry will be distinguished from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
old by its form not less than its spirit,&#8221; he proclaimed
magisterially. &#8220;I have come to the conclusion to
discard the sonnet in favor of the acrostic.&#8221; (There
was an acrostic in the &#8220;Rosary of Twilight.&#8221;) &#8220;Form
is the essence of art, and the acrostic represents form
in its severest limitations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Form <i>is</i> art,&#8221; flashed Alistair, who saw through
the visitor&#8217;s strategy, and felt maliciously disposed
to balk him. It had always been an honourable understanding
among the Decadents that they were to
listen to each other&#8217;s poems and look at each other&#8217;s
pictures, as some slight mutual compensation for the
deafness and blindness of the middle class. But it
seemed scarcely fair to extend the benefit of this arrangement
to the poetry of the Catholic renascence.</p>

<p>Vane blinked, but recovered himself promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what I said. Form is art or its essence.
For that reason it ought not to be concealed. In the
acrostic form takes its right place as the governing
condition of the whole.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wickham dutifully came to his brother&#8217;s reinforcement.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is why I find tapestry so far superior to
painting,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;The limitations of the
needle are so much severer than those of the brush;
their influence over the composition is so much more
obvious. There is something vulgar in dexterity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there not something vulgar in expression itself?&#8221;
Stuart put in. &#8220;Surely the unexpressed is always
higher than the expressed?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>This was a wedge driven between the opposing
forces. Wickham, whose claims to consideration rested
entirely on the meditations in which he was believed
to indulge, could not reject the principle which
justified his existence. Egerton, fretting with impatience,
began to fear that he should be reduced to
the coarse man&#339;uvre of openly seizing his book and
reading unasked.</p>

<p>But even this was not to be permitted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;For my part,&#8221; Stuart said, &#8220;I consider that as
the first word of literature was the riddle, so it must
be the last. Poetry is falsehood, and we should never
be allowed to tell the truth. Remember that when
Shakespeare ventured to talk poetry to Ben Jonson
in the Mermaid Tavern, he &#8216;had to be stopped.&#8217; The
poet will always be stopped by respectable people
when he talks prose, and that is why he has to talk
poetry, which they can&#8217;t understand. Take my advice,
throw your acrostics overboard, and write riddles.
Write them in Sanskrit if possible, and use a
cipher. That will give you all the limitations you
want. And the middle class will form a Vane Society,
as they have formed a Shakespeare Society and a
Browning Society, to interpret you; and when you
are dead they will write biographies to prove that you
were fairly orthodox and perfectly respectable.&#8221;</p>

<p>The author of the &#8220;Rosary of Twilight,&#8221; as he
walked home in dudgeon, observed to the fraternal
satellite:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>&#8220;I am afraid Stuart is deteriorating. He seems
to be incapable of high seriousness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He needs to surround himself with pale green
tapestry,&#8221; was the melancholy response.</p>

<p>Others of Alistair&#8217;s old circle came round him in
his new home, and rejoiced in this fresh defiance to
the Victorian proprieties. But there was one notable
absentee. The figure of the Brazilian banker was
never seen in the little high-art kitchen. Since Molly
Finucane had become Lady Alistair, Mendes had
been struck off her visiting-list.</p>

<small>LADY ALISTAIR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Bernard Vanbrugh</span> kept his own counsel
about his conversation with Lord Alistair, as he had
done about the Duke of Trent&#8217;s proposal.</p>

<p>In a brief letter from London Alistair told Hero
the truth.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;If I am a scapegoat of others&#8221; (he wrote), &#8220;I
cannot let you be my scapegoat. My life, I am told,
must be a cul-de-sac, and you must not think of walking
down it with me. I ought to have seen this all
along; perhaps I did suspect it; but I was forlorn and
you made me happy. Now I can only do my best
not to make you miserable. Forgive my mother for
her share in the mischief that has been done, and try
to forgive and forget.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Alistair Stuart</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>This letter made no difference to Hero whatever.
She guessed that her father had influenced Alistair
to write it, but she forbore to speak to him on the
subject. Her mind was made up, and so was his,
and further discussion between them would only make
them both unhappy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>She carried the letter to Alistair&#8217;s mother, who had
been left wondering and dismayed by his unexplained
departure, and the two women who loved Alistair
embraced and shed some tears over it.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will come back to you if you will wait for
him,&#8221; the mother pleaded. The language of the letter
was outside her comprehension, but she thought
she knew what was in Alistair&#8217;s heart. &#8220;He has
drawn back because he is afraid he cannot make you
a good husband. But he has not really given you up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not given him up, at all events,&#8221; Hero
said quietly.</p>

<p>The Duchess felt greatly comforted. Only her old
misgiving came back to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose he means to marry that woman?&#8221; she
whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I shall look upon his wife as my sister. I
shall try to make a friend of her for his sake, and
I think I shall succeed. After all, perhaps I have
no right to take her place.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mother was daunted by this answer. She
could not bear to admit that Molly Finucane had any
rights where Alistair was concerned. She would have
liked to see Hero more jealous.</p>

<p>The news of the marriage reached them only
through the newspaper. Alistair had thought it would
be affectation to try to soften the blow.</p>

<p>It was a dreadful blow to the Duchess, though she
had seen it coming. She sank under it, and aged visibly.
Hero tried in vain to administer consolation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>&#8220;I think Alistair has acted nobly,&#8221; she declared.
&#8220;I am proud of him. And I should be proud of myself
if I thought he had done it to please me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor Duchess began to fear that Hero, instead
of an ally, was going to prove a traitor. She could
see in her son&#8217;s action nothing but desperation. She
had her own settled view as to what would constitute
happiness for her boy, and she wanted to see
him happy.</p>

<p>Hero wrote in the same courageous strain to Alistair
himself. And she enclosed a short note to Molly,
asking permission as a cordial friend of Lord Alistair&#8217;s
to congratulate her on a step which she believed
and hoped would be for the happiness of them both.</p>

<p>When Molly got the letter, she was puzzled and
rather alarmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Miss Vanbrugh the girl your mother wanted
you to marry?&#8221; she asked her husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. But you see I married you instead,&#8221; was
all Alistair said in reply.</p>

<p>And Molly did not dare to question him further.
She answered Hero&#8217;s letter as ungraciously as she
could, though her new sense of dignity kept her within
the bounds of formal civility. She hoped that this
would be the end of all intercourse in that quarter.</p>

<p>Neither Alistair nor his wife had any suspicion that
their new residence was within the charitable rounds
of the Duchess of Trent. The dwellers in Beers
Cooperage were equally ignorant that their new neighbour
was her Grace&#8217;s son. They had soon given up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
the notion that he was among them as a social or
religious missionary, and now cherished the exciting
belief that he was in hiding from the police, who
would presently appear on the scene, and drag him
off with all dramatic circumstance.</p>

<p>Alistair had concealed his address from nobody;
on the contrary, he had taken pains to transmit it to
the editor of every directory in which his name was
included. The ratification of his bankruptcy had left
him with a pleasing sense of freedom, and the sale of
Molly&#8217;s furniture had provided for present needs.</p>

<p>When the Duchess returned to Colonsay House,
her first thought was for Beers Cooperage. She
dreaded a meeting with her daughter-in-law so much
that she was tempted to relinquish her visits to the
little yard. But a sense that it would be cowardly
to make her poor friends suffer on this account co-operated
with some human curiosity to overcome her
repugnance. She decided to go to the Cooperage as
usual, and take her chance of meeting its new inmates.</p>

<p>Hero disappointed her friend by refusing to accompany
her. She made it her excuse that she intended
to call on Lady Alistair, and did not wish the
compliment to be lessened by association with charitable
visits.</p>

<p>She had another reason which she did not tell the
Duchess. She feared that Alistair&#8217;s mother was incapable
of dealing tactfully with such a woman as
Molly Finucane. Indeed, she had shown herself little
able to deal with her own son. Hero was determined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
to be the friend of both, and in order to be
so she saw that she must not let herself be identified
with the Duchess.</p>

<p>Caroline delayed so long that it was Miss Vanbrugh
who first made Lady Alistair&#8217;s acquaintance.</p>

<p>She drove to the Cooperage in her father&#8217;s carriage
at the fashionable hour of the afternoon, walked
up the yard without noticing its inmates, except by a
nod in passing, and knocked at the bright green door.</p>

<p>It was opened by Alistair himself, who could not
restrain an exclamation of pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Lady Alistair at home?&#8221; Hero asked smilingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have come to call on her? That is good of
you! She is upstairs; I will fetch her down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hero detained him by a gesture, as she whispered
swiftly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell her that it is good of me. Don&#8217;t praise
me to her at all. And leave us together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair understood. He placed Hero in one of
the Cromwellian armchairs, and went upstairs wearing
a look of indifference.</p>

<p>He found Molly seated on her bed, looking very
fierce and flushed. Her ladyship had inspected the
visitor from overhead through the window, and immediately
prepared for battle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is she?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>Alistair shrugged his shoulders with well-assumed
carelessness.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Miss Vanbrugh, the girl who wrote to you,
you know.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>&#8220;What has she come here for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s a call. She asked if you were at
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said yes. You hadn&#8217;t told me that you didn&#8217;t
want to receive callers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Molly felt herself baffled. She bit her lip, and
looked hard at Alistair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our marriage was announced in the paper,&#8221; he
said, pushing his advantage. &#8220;That entitles my
friends to call on you, I suppose. In fact, it would
be rather marked if they did not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mother hasn&#8217;t called.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. That is rather marked.&#8221;</p>

<p>Molly saw she was in a dilemma. She would have
been glad to cut off all further acquaintance between
her husband and this girl, of whom she had such
good reason to be jealous. But Miss Vanbrugh&#8217;s
visit offered an opening into society, that respectable
society which had been the object of her ambition for
so long. It was the first opening that had presented
itself, and it might very easily be the last.</p>

<p>Lady Alistair decided to sacrifice jealousy to ambition,
and, like other wives, to make her husband suffer
for the sacrifice.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that she has only come to see you,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you think so you can stay up here. I will go
down and tell her that you have a headache.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you would like that, wouldn&#8217;t you? Me to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
stay up here by myself, while you and her enjoy yourselves
without me! I shall come down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may do as you please. But if you imagine
that Miss Vanbrugh or any other lady would consent
to stay and talk with the master of the house while
the mistress keeps out of the room, you have a good
deal to pick up.&#8221;</p>

<p>This speech produced an effect on Lady Alistair.
She did not resent receiving lessons in social etiquette.</p>

<p>&#8220;You want me as a chaperon, I suppose,&#8221; she
grumbled, hastily touching up her toilet and complexion.</p>

<p>&#8220;What nonsense! I doubt if I shall stay in the
room. You must learn to entertain your own
visitors.&#8221;</p>

<p>Incredulous, but silenced, Molly descended and
faced the enemy with a warlike front.</p>

<p>At the first sight and speech of Hero she felt herself
half disarmed. The perfect sincerity, the clear
nobility of nature, that shone in Hero&#8217;s face, put
every thought of vulgar jealousy instantly to shame.
This woman might be a rival, and a formidable one,
in the sense that a mother or a bachelor friend is
the rival of a selfish wife, but she would never be a
rival in any other sense.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Lady Alistair, I am afraid I have been
rather slow in calling, but we have been abroad, and
when we got back I found I had really nothing to
wear. What do you do for your autumn hats?&#8221;</p>

<p>One glance at the overdressed and bejewelled little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
woman had taught Hero the way to her friendship.
Once lured on to the ground of millinery Molly
became interested and animated before she knew it,
and Stuart found himself provided with a good excuse
for slipping out of the room.</p>

<p>The new Lady Alistair had expected to feel embarrassed
in talking to the first lady she had ever met,
and she had prepared to carry off her embarrassment
by insolence. It was a surprise, and an agreeable
one, to find herself chatting easily and pleasantly with
the new-comer on topics that she thoroughly understood.
Instead of being schooled and patronized, it
was she whose superior knowledge of fashions and
fashionable shops enabled her to impart information,
and almost to condescend.</p>

<p>Hero was not contented with this opening success.
She wanted to be Molly&#8217;s friend, and not merely to
be friends with Molly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a clever idea to take this little house!&#8221; she
said, as soon as the opportunity served. &#8220;And what
a charming nest you have made of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is rather poky,&#8221; said Lady Alistair, not quite
sure whether her visitor was speaking sincerely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but how cosy you must find it! Everybody
loves cottages, but then so few of us can afford to
live in them. My father, for instance&mdash;of course, as
a working professional man he is obliged to consider
the opinion of his patients.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose so,&#8221; Molly assented. It made her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
quite gracious to think that Miss Vanbrugh recognized
her own social inferiority.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should not wonder if you set the fashion,&#8221; Hero
pursued. &#8220;I am sure there must be lots of people
who are tired of flats.&#8221;</p>

<p>Molly was surprised by her visitor&#8217;s discernment.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Chevalier Vane, a friend of ours, talks of
taking the cottage next door,&#8221; she said, with satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be just the thing for you, won&#8217;t it?
I know Lord Alistair well enough to be sure that he
wants plenty of society. I expect you have hard work
sometimes to find distractions for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hint sank into Molly&#8217;s mind. Frivolous and
stupid as she was, she was able to see that this new
friend was giving her sound advice, and she was not
ungrateful for it. Alistair had married her, but
whether he would continue to live with her would
depend a good deal on how far she succeeded in making
his home a pleasant one.</p>

<p>Poor Molly! She had caged her bird, but she had
yet to see if she could make it sing.</p>

<p>Hero would not go away till she had coaxed Molly
into making tea. She praised the furniture, the copper
saucepans, the new cuckoo clock, the absence of
servants&mdash;everything about the house, till its mistress
began to think that she must be really a most
enviable housewife. When Alistair rejoined them
over the tea, he found Molly in a better humour than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
he ever remembered. And he was careful to do nothing
to break the charm.</p>

<p>As he escorted Hero down the yard to her carriage
he thanked her earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your visit has been like an angel&#8217;s&mdash;only let me
hope there will be no &#8216;far between.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will come as often as I think your wife wishes
me to,&#8221; was the gentle answer. &#8220;Be sure you do
nothing to make me unwelcome to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The advice was not unnecessary. After Miss Vanbrugh
had departed Molly began to doubt whether
she had done well in being so friendly. She tried the
experiment of disparaging the visitor to her husband,
watching him keenly to see the effect of her remarks.
But Alistair was on his guard, and only responded by
shrugging his shoulders and saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t like her you needn&#8217;t see any more
of her. You have only not to return the call, and
the Vanbrughs will leave us alone. If you do return
it, I suppose they will ask us to dinner. Please yourself.
As long as you don&#8217;t interfere with my friendships
I won&#8217;t interfere with yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prospect of going to a real dinner-party&mdash;a
dinner-party at which ladies would be present&mdash;was
a strong temptation to Molly. She decided that the
acquaintance must be kept up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I shall return her call,&#8221; she said sharply.
&#8220;What do you take me for? Do you think I&#8217;m
jealous of an ordinary girl like that, who doesn&#8217;t even
know where to get her gloves?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>During the next few days there was a perceptible
change in Molly&#8217;s behaviour towards her husband.
She suggested his going to look up some of his
friends, and asked him to choose at what place they
should dine.</p>

<p>It was in the midst of this effort of the little creature&#8217;s
to be a good wife to Alistair that Alistair&#8217;s
mother came to see her.</p>

<p>Caroline had found her simple morality confused
by the transformation of Molly Finucane into Lady
Alistair Stuart. Ordinarily the marriage ceremony
would have amounted in her view to a complete white-washing
of the sinner. It was the atonement prescribed
by all her social and religious canons. But
this particular marriage concerned her as a mother.
She could not but view with jealousy an atonement
made at her son&#8217;s expense, and she found an excuse
for condemnation in the fact that the marriage had
taken place in a registry office. The Duchess was
not so strong a Churchwoman as to deem it no marriage
at all, but she could, and did, regard it as something
short of that reconciliation with righteousness
and respectability which a union blessed by the Church
would have been.</p>

<p>She could not forgive her son&#8217;s wife, but she could
not quite condemn her. In this frame of mind she
made her way to Beers Cooperage one morning before
lunch, determined to give her first visit a neutral
character.</p>

<p>The appearance of the Duchess after an absence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
of so many weeks caused a flutter of excitement in
the little court, and all its inhabitants hastened out
of doors to greet her.</p>

<p>As it happened, Lady Alistair was in her house
alone, and hearing the sounds, she went to the window
and looked out.</p>

<p>The spectacle of an elderly lady in old-fashioned
black silk walking up the yard amid the throng of
her dependents told Molly nothing. It was an entire
surprise to see the visitor advance straight to her own
door, and to hear her say to the people thronging
round her: &#8220;I am going in here first. I will see
you all again when I come out.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the absence of a servant, Molly was half inclined
to let the visitor knock in vain. But, after all,
a visit paid at such an hour could hardly be one of
ceremony. Most likely the old thing wanted to ask
her for a subscription: she would surely not presume
to talk religion to her when she was informed of her
rank.</p>

<p>Determined to put the intruder in her place at
once, Molly went leisurely to the door and threw it
open.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want to see me?&#8221; she asked roughly.</p>

<p>Caroline gazed at the pretty painted face that she
had brought herself to believe had been her boy&#8217;s
undoing, and there was not much relenting in the
gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you my son&#8217;s wife?&#8221; she returned, with
gravity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>Molly was taken aback. The idea that this old
person, evidently a familiar figure in the court, should
be the mother of Lord Alistair quite confused her
for an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you the Duchess of Trent?&#8221; she stammered,
with a shamefaced recollection of certain correspondence
that had once passed between them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Alistair&#8217;s mother,&#8221; was the response. &#8220;Is
he here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has gone out,&#8221; said Molly. Then, realizing
that she was standing in the doorway, and that the
interview was being watched by a number of curious
eyes, she drew aside hastily. &#8220;But won&#8217;t you come
inside?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will, thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess walked in with great deliberation, and
seated herself, upright and stately, in Molly&#8217;s own
chair, exactly as she was accustomed to do in one of
her poor people&#8217;s cottages when about to admonish
a drunken husband or a slatternly wife. The poor
people, who knew that the lecture was really an excuse
offered by the Duchess to her own conscience
for the forgiveness and solid kindness that were to
follow, always listened meekly enough. Unfortunately
Molly did not know anything except that she
was on her defence. These court martial airs roused
her spirit, and she sailed across the room with a
flushed face, and cast herself down with insolent negligence
on the settle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been a district visitor in this neighbourhood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
for some years. I don&#8217;t know whether you were
aware of it when you took this house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Molly, &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t. But I don&#8217;t think
I should have had any objection.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess frowned. She had come, not prepared
to make peace, perhaps, but disposed to entertain
a truce. Now the enemy seemed not to desire
either peace or truce.</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked because I could not understand my son&#8217;s
choice of such a residence. Does he really mean to
stay here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must ask him that. I suppose he will leave
it when I do&mdash;not before.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess, routed from her own position, was
obliged to accept Molly&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why have you brought him here? Do you wish
him to forfeit his place in society altogether?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what society you mean. Our friends
are visiting us here as usual, and they think the place
charming. If it keeps away frumps and bores, so
much the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline was confounded. In her mind the common
notions of her generation on the subjects of piety,
morality, and social propriety were inextricably blended.
Quite unconsciously to herself she had included
in her scheme for Alistair&#8217;s salvation the possession
of a big Cubitt-built house in Eaton Square, with menservants
eating five substantial meals a day in the basement,
and doing little else; a carriage and pair, conveying
him and his wife to an endless round of serious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
entertainments in other Cubitt-built houses, wherein
similar menservants ate similar meals; the directorship
of some respectable railway or insurance company
to occupy his mind; a seat on a hospital committee
by way of good works; and, above all, a stately
pew furnished with red cushions and hassocks, in
which he would be seen regularly every Sunday morning,
carrying the glossiest of silk hats and wearing
the straightest of frock-coats. No doubt she placed
first of all that spiritual change which she deemed
necessary to all men, but she believed that if Alistair
were once converted all these other things would be
added unto him, and perhaps she also believed, without
being conscious of it, that if the other things were
present the conversion would be added.</p>

<p>Molly&#8217;s own ideal was really very similar. The
Cubitt-built life was the life for which she hankered
with all a woman&#8217;s thirst for the envy of other women.
If the Duchess had known it she might have
found in Molly a much more trustworthy ally than in
Hero Vanbrugh. But she was never likely to know
it. For her Molly embodied every evil influence at
work in Alistair&#8217;s life. The evil had triumphed, and
the best that could now be hoped for was some poor
salvage from the wreck.</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of friends?&#8221; she said, in answer to
Molly&#8217;s last remarks. &#8220;I am afraid my poor boy&#8217;s
friendships have done him more harm than good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His relations haven&#8217;t done much for him
anyway.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>The two women regarded each other with unconcealed
hostility as they exchanged these retorts. It
was a new experience for the Duchess to be defied in
this open fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid you must take the responsibility for
that,&#8221; she said severely. &#8220;His brother and I were
both trying to save him, but you prevented us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How? By marrying him, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why should that prevent your doing anything
for him? I know! If he had married your Miss
Vanbrugh, as you wanted, the Duke would have paid
off his debts fast enough. Because he preferred me
you wash your hands of him in revenge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did not prefer you,&#8221; said the Duchess sternly.
&#8220;He thought that after living with you as he had
done he was unfit to be the husband of a good
woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a merciless stab, the stab of a mother fighting
for her offspring. For an instant Molly felt sick.
Then, to the dismay of her adversary, she burst into
tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a cruel, wicked woman to say a thing
like that. You hate me because I love Alistair, and
you know that he loves me. What do you want me
to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess&#8217;s conscience smote her. She sat there
unable to make a reply. After all, now that this
wretched marriage had taken place, what did she want
Alistair&#8217;s wife to do?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>Molly, unconscious of the difficulty, removed it by
putting her question in a different form.</p>

<p>&#8220;He came back to me of his own accord,&#8221; she
sobbed. &#8220;I was living here&mdash;with my brother&mdash;and
he came and asked me to marry him. What ought I
to have done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew that such a marriage would be his
ruin. You ought to have saved him from it, if you
really did love him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what about me?&#8221; moaned the dejected
Molly.</p>

<p>The Duchess felt a momentary shame.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are Homes,&#8221; she said, with hesitation,
&#8220;where women who desire to lead better lives are
encouraged and trained to become useful members
of society.&#8221;</p>

<p>Molly sat up, and dashed away the tears that were
making havoc of her rouge and powder.</p>

<p>&#8220;And is that what you want to do to me? Put me
into a reformatory, and cut my hair, and make me
go about in a grey dress and an apron, saying &#8216;Ma&#8217;am&#8217;
to a lot of old maids who are too ugly themselves for
any man to want them? and then get me a situation
as a servant or something, where I should always be
patronized and watched to see that I didn&#8217;t enjoy
myself? No, thank you! I won&#8217;t go into your
Home! I won&#8217;t&mdash;I won&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess rose to her feet slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some other time, when you are calmer&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she
began.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to be calm!&#8221; Molly cried fiercely.
&#8220;And I&#8217;m not going to be good either&mdash;not in your
way. Why should I? Why should I pretend to be
ashamed of myself, and make long faces&mdash;repent, as
you call it&mdash;to please you? I don&#8217;t want your good
opinion. I never asked for it. All I want is for you
to leave me alone. You think you are very good
and gracious, I dare say, to talk to a girl like me. I
don&#8217;t see it. If you really wanted to be kind, you
would be kind to me now, as I am. It is easy enough
to forgive people when they have left off doing what
you don&#8217;t like; the thing is to forgive them while
they are still doing it. If I joined the Salvation Army,
and wore a poke-bonnet, you would have nothing to
say against me. Bah! You&#8217;re like all the rest; I
know you. Get us to go down at your feet and be
miserable, and then you take credit for forgiving us.
And that&#8217;s what you call Christianity!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess had stumbled to the door and escaped
before Molly lost her breath.</p>

<p>Alistair&#8217;s mother tottered down the yard, too much
agitated to remember her pensioners, and Alistair&#8217;s
wife lay on the high-art settle, with the copper pans
gleaming down at her, and wept as if her heart would
break.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />


<small>THE HOUSE OF CATILINE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> those friends of Lord Alistair&#8217;s who did
not neglect him in his fallen state was the moving
spirit of the Legitimist Guild.</p>

<p>The Comte des Louvres visited the house in Beers
Cooperage, and professed himself enchanted with
everything about it, but most of all with its nearness
to Chestnut-Tree Walk.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are neighbours now,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;and I
shall expect you to look me up very often. Drop in
whenever you have nothing better to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Frenchman threw a flattering deference into
his manner towards Molly now that her position
seemed to be established. He was keen enough to
see the direction in which her ambitions pointed, and
he threw out hints of his ability to help her.</p>

<p>By way of a beginning he invited her to his house
to meet some of the ladies who had held stalls at the
famous bazaar. Lady Alistair did not refuse the
invitations. She appeared in the Count&#8217;s shabby
drawing-room, flaunting in the extravagance of the
past, and scored a feminine triumph over women
whose whole yearly dress allowance would not have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
paid for one of her frocks. But Molly was too shrewd
to mistake these gatherings, at which tea was handed
round by the two Vanes, and the conversation turned
chiefly on the Legitimist cause and its prospects, for
the kind of society she had aspired to. The women
to whom Des Louvres introduced her were as much
outside the pale as herself, though for different reasons,
and in the end they tired her by their pretentious
gentility, and she left off trying to mix with
them.</p>

<p>It was borne in upon the poor little woman that
her dream of respectability was never likely to be
realized. The cruel frankness of the Duchess had
broken her spirit. The dismal vision of the Home
began to rise up before her as a final destiny. Very
often she cried now when she was alone. It seemed
to her that life could never be jolly again. Nothing
had turned out as she had hoped. Marriage seemed
to have made things worse instead of better. Alistair
left her to herself as much as formerly, and when
he was with her they had less and less to say to one
another. And they became really poor. The Duke&#8217;s
intentions as regards his brother&#8217;s allowance remained
undeclared. In the meantime the South Kensington
furniture, the copper saucepans, and the
Cromwellian oak had been bought on the hire system,
and there was trouble about the instalments.
Once or twice already they had had to dine at home
on slices of ham brought in from a shop in the Westminster
Bridge Road, because they could not afford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
a meal at a restaurant. And now the winter was
upon them.</p>

<p>After all, Molly had not returned Miss Vanbrugh&#8217;s
call. And this was not because she was jealous of
her, but because when it came to the point she found
she had not the courage. In Hero&#8217;s presence, in
the light of her candid eyes, the pretence of being
a lady could not be kept up. Perhaps Hero guessed
how matters stood, for when she found that Lady
Alistair did not come to her she made the experiment
of coming again to Beers Cooperage. And Molly
was very glad to see her. To her own surprise, she
found her once dreaded rival was her only friend.
They grew to call each other by their Christian names.
And by degrees Molly opened her heart to Hero,
and told her everything; told her one day, with tears
and sobs, the story of her miserable life, and wound
up with the despairing cry:</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall never be any better; I know I shan&#8217;t. I
can&#8217;t be sorry. I can&#8217;t repent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hero held out her arms. When she reached home
that evening she found the bosom of her dress all
streaked with rouge.</p>

<p>Alistair&#8217;s wife was not blinded by the respectful
homage of the Comte des Louvres to his true character.
Her instinct told her that the Count had no
friendships which did not serve some purpose of his
own, and she warned Alistair against him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beware of that man,&#8221; she said one day after the
Frenchman had been to see them. &#8220;He pretends to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
be your friend, but he is scheming to get something
out of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most friends are,&#8221; was Alistair&#8217;s retort. &#8220;Of
course, Des Louvres is a scoundrel, but he is an interesting
one. Honest men are such bores.&#8221;</p>

<p>And in that remark Alistair expressed more of his
character than he knew. Perhaps the strongest of
all the motives that stirred him to quarrel with the
social order in which he had been reared was that he
found it dull. He judged of life like a novel&mdash;it is
the villain who is the soul of the plot.</p>

<p>If he had been born fifty years before, Alistair
Stuart might have been happily engaged among those
who were struggling for the emancipation of Europe
from the old Legitimist r&eacute;gime. Political liberty,
the liberty that Shelley had hymned, and Mazzini
plotted, and Garibaldi fought for, seemed a Dead
Sea fruit to his taste, but yet at least the struggle
for it had been worth waging. To-day nothing interesting,
nothing heroic, was going on in the world.
The glorious dawn of the nineteenth century had been
succeeded by a commonplace day. The struggles of
the hour were for markets and mines; the question
that moved men&#8217;s souls was whether Mike Finigan
should be compelled to hide his glass of beer from the
respectable sight of Mr. Stiggins.</p>

<p>Liberalism was dead, and the social democracy
marching over its corpse had discarded every noble
watchword, every lofty ideal, and proclaimed the
naked issue of more wages and less work. They and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
the millionaires might fight it out between them as
far as such as Alistair were concerned. Neither side
seemed likely to add anything to the beauty of life.</p>

<p>In the house in Chestnut-Tree Walk he found himself
brought into touch with an altogether different
world. It was a strange underground world, a world
of decayed races, and lost causes, and fallen dynasties,
and overthrown gods. Sometimes it seemed to him
a world of pure make-believe, in which everything
was pasteboard and tinsel, and at other times it
seemed to him that there was a meaning hidden beneath
the make-believe, that there was a strength in
all this decay capable of assailing and overcoming
in time the strength of the world of triumphant causes
and conquering races; that from this concealed and
stagnant source a power of corruption might arise,
like the pestilence that issues from the slums of Canton
or the pilgrim-ships of Mecca and devastates
Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>Alistair became a more and more frequent visitor
to the house hidden behind the grimy chestnut-trees.
Des Louvres was never a dull companion. He possessed
a unique knowledge of contemporary European
history, especially of that part of history which does
not get into books, and which the underbred provincials
who compile scholastic histories seem never to
understand. His memory for royal genealogies was
equal to that of a German Court Chamberlain. And
he was not ignorant of British pedigrees either.</p>

<p>On one occasion he surprised Stuart by asking him:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>&#8220;You are related to the Earls of Mar, are you
not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My grandmother was an Erskine,&#8221; Alistair replied.
&#8220;Why do you ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your ancestor headed the first Jacobite rising on
behalf of James III,&#8221; said Des Louvres, with a significant
glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is sometimes called the Earl of Mar&#8217;s Rebellion,&#8221;
responded Alistair. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t think my
ancestor distinguished himself very much. He made
his arrangements very badly, and quarrelled with the
Pretender when he came over.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other did not pursue the subject. But his
remark had taken effect on Stuart&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>In addition to Des Louvres there were often other
interesting figures to be met with at Chestnut-Tree
House: Frenchmen fresh from the boulevards; Austrians
and Spaniards with the latest gossip of their
capitals; urbane Roman priests, affecting the diplomatist
rather than the cleric, and anxious that the
Duke of Trent&#8217;s brother should take an interest in
the absorbing question of the Temporal Power.</p>

<p>&#8220;There never was a more interesting State than the
Pope&#8217;s,&#8221; Stuart was told. &#8220;It was government by the
refined and intellectual class, the aristocracy of mind
and birth combined. There was no public opinion,
which, as you know, always means vulgar middle-class
opinion. There was no Puritan inquisition; Garibaldi
and his brigands made it their chief complaint
against us that we did not persecute the sinner. Every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
man could do as he pleased, in short, provided that
he did not openly assail the Church. Of course, no
Sovereign can tolerate rebellion. For artists and poets,
for all men of taste and originality, the Rome of
the Popes was an almost perfect home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair grew more and more inclined to believe it.
More and more he came to feel that he had no quarrel
with the Church of Rome. It had never persecuted
him. On the contrary, it had treated him with
consideration at a time when he had received no consideration
from those who owed it to him most.</p>

<p>He would have been glad enough to believe that
a restored Papal State would afford him the city of
refuge for which he yearned, and if he raised objections
the tempters easily swept them away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was not the press muzzled?&#8221; he would ask.
&#8220;Was there not a censorship of books?&#8221;</p>

<p>And the answer would be that the democratic press
was equally muzzled, only it was muzzled by a golden
muzzle. A paper could not be launched, except at
a cost only within the means of the very rich. It
could not be carried on at all without the revenue
derived from the pill-makers and the soap-makers;
and the pill-maker would permit nothing to appear
in it that might by any possibility offend his bilious
customers. The rich man would not tolerate any paper
that did not pander to the passionate greed which
was fast becoming more than a disease&mdash;a veritable
possession.</p>

<p>And there was a censorship of books as well, a censorship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
administered, not by educated men, but by
policemen hounded to their work by rabid zealots
in whom sexual perversion took the form of prudery.
There were commercial censorships and voluntary
ones. A tradesman, sitting in his office, held in his
hands the fate of half the books brought out in England.
The committees of the Free Libraries were
more intolerant than any Roman congregation. Were
not their shelves choked with the rubbish of evangelical
serialists, and barred to the masterpieces of De
Maupassant and D&#8217;Annunzio? The real censorships
of books in every age had been exercised by human
stupidity. The Index Expurgatorius of ignorance and
spite was vaster than the British Museum Catalogue.</p>

<p>Stuart found himself more than half committed to
the cause already. His effort on behalf of Don Juan,
slight and unsuccessful as it had been, had brought
him a letter of thanks from the Prince, and an invitation
to call on him if Lord Alistair should ever find
himself in Rome. Des Louvres continued to speak
hopefully of the Pretender&#8217;s prospects. And in the
meanwhile it became more and more clear to Alistair
that Don Juan&#8217;s cause, and all these romantic causes
and whispering conspiracies centred in the one supreme
cause and the one secular conspiracy represented
by that immemorial figure, crowned with the
triple crown of Ra, grasping the keys of Sheol and
Amenti, and pursuing in the name of the Crucified
One the empire of the Conqueror.</p>

<p>In the same measure that Alistair Stuart was attracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
to the camp of these rebels against the established
order he was repelled from that rival camp
whose red flag was the symbol of an international
Jacquerie.</p>

<p>Every poet is at heart an anarchist, but his vocation
bids him be a transcendental one, perceiving that
sympathy is stronger than violence, and the seed that
bursts unseen and silently is a more formidable engine
than the bomb. Alistair found in the proletarian propaganda,
so far as it had come under his notice, a
leaven of envy and hatred of the best. The spirit of
Marat&#8217;s bloody apostolate lurked under words like
brotherhood and humanity. It was not only against
the rich and the tyrannical that the red flag waved;
it menaced equally knowledge and genius. Archimedes
would fare no better at such hands than he had
fared at the hands of the soldier of Marcellus. The
policy of these helot Tarquins was to strike down the
tall flowers of the garden, roses and nettles together.</p>

<p>His three months&#8217; sojourn in Beers Cooperage had
taught Alistair that he could not really be the brother
of his humble neighbours. He was not nearer to
them in spirit than if he were dwelling in Colonsay
House. He was too kind-hearted not to wish to befriend
them, but he could only do so as he befriended
children and animals&mdash;without feeling himself as one
of them. His common sense, or, what is the same
thing, his sense of humour, saved him from trying
to elevate them by means of wireless telegraphy and
the Andaman Islands. The simple truth was that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
no more wanted to change their natures than to
change his own. He was that rare thing, an individualist
who respected the individuality of others.
He was the only person who had ever bestowed
money in the Cooperage without asking whether it
was to be spent on tea or on beer. In his mother&#8217;s
opinion he was doing harm to the neighbourhood.
Among the beneficiaries a suspicion had begun to
germinate that he must have his eye on a seat in the
County Council. His favourite manifestation of interest
was to call in passing organ-grinders, who
played in the Cooperage by the hour together, while
the children danced.</p>

<p>Alistair could make his poor neighbours happy, but
they could not make him happy.</p>

<p>The poet searching for his Eden places it ever in
some environment which he has not yet tried. Whole
generations of priest-ridden Italians had placed the
home of freedom in Puritan-ridden England; it was
natural that Alistair should place it in Papal Rome.</p>

<p>Des Louvres, the Catiline of this conspiracy, had
just that touch of the bohemian in his own character
which enabled him to understand Stuart. He did not
hope to rouse in him any active enthusiasm for the
small territorial ambitions of the Catholic Pretenders,
clerical or lay. But he saw that what Stuart wanted
was a stick with which to beat society, and the Legitimist
stick was as good as any other. Little by
little he drew his proselyte on to the view that all
the elements that made the Victorian Order hateful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
to him were personified in the reigning House itself.
The Hanoverian dynasty was a Protestant dynasty&mdash;or,
at least, it was required to pose as such in public.
The Act of Settlement was the work of the Low
Church party, supported by the Nonconformists; in
other words, it was the Puritan settlement. All English
history, all English literature, all English society,
had rested hitherto on the basis that the Low Church
party was in the right, and that its standards ought
to govern Great Britain, and Ireland, and India, and
ultimately the whole world.</p>

<p>Alistair himself had been brought up in an atmosphere
where that assumption was not supposed to be
even subject to discussion. The whole world, to his
youthful mind, had been divided into two classes&mdash;those
who were Low Churchmen, and those who
ought to be, and knew it. He, Alistair, knew it, so
did the others, from the General of the Jesuits to
the stone-breaker suspected of being a Plymouth
Brother, and from the condemned murderer to the
author of the &#8220;Origin of Species.&#8221; The Sultan of
Turkey knew it in his heart, and so did every follower
of every other faith, except, possibly, the Grand
Lama, protected by geographical barriers from the
enterprise of the Low Church Missionary Society.</p>

<p>And now all these assumptions were breaking up
and melting away so rapidly that the mere statement
of them sounded more like satire than sober record.
Histories of England were being written, and were
being used in the schools, which failed to teach that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
the Revolution of 1688 was the most glorious event
in the annals of the human race. It was no longer
universally deemed an act of oppression on the part
of James I. to permit the peasantry to dance on Sunday.
Even the Reformation had ceased to be the
subject of unmitigated eulogy. The rising generation
were being allowed to perceive that some bigotry
goes to the making of a martyr, as well as of a heretic-hunter.
The failings of the leading Reformers were
no longer veiled, and the virtues of their opponents
were lovingly conceded.</p>

<p>Every revelation passes through three stages: first,
it is a heresy; next, a commonplace; and last, a superstition.
The mind of man revolves like his planet,
and truths rise and set like the stars.</p>

<p>Protestantism had survived into the third stage.
The great Protestant Churches still flourished, but
they no longer professed the Protestant religion. The
Church of England was suing for recognition by the
Church of Rome. The Dissenting Churches, founded
by men who were more willing to endure poverty
and prison than to wear a surplice, or to use a ring
in the marriage ceremony, were adopting liturgies
and vestments. The evangelical organizations, the
Missionary Societies, the Bible Societies, the Tract
Societies, were still in full activity, but they had ceased
to evangelize. Like the Churches, they lived on their
inheritance; they were kept going by the dead hand.
Frock-coated committees were called together by well-salaried
secretaries to dispose of funds too large for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
the shrunken field of endeavour; but, wiser than the
augurs of old Rome, the secretaries never smiled.</p>

<p>The machinery went on with well-oiled wheels, but
the spirit was gone. The foundation stone of the
building had been almost accidentally mined. The
picks of excavators toiling at the dust-heaps beside
the Tigris and Euphrates that once were Nineveh and
Babylon, had turned up a handful of arrow-stamped
bricks, and the Protestant Bible had become a mere
human document. The whole of English society was
engaged in a conspiracy to suppress the fact that the
world was changing. The schools and universities
went on teaching that it never changed; the pulpits
proved that it could not; the newspapers were positive
that it had not; yet underneath all this loud shouting
of the cohorts of respectability could be heard a murmur
like the whisper of Galileo before the Inquisition&mdash;<i>But
it does move</i>.</p>

<p>It was the close of the Victorian Age. It was an
age which had recorded its own praises on a myriad
monuments, and chanted them in thunder on the days
of jubilee. It was an age which had gazed round
upon its mighty works, and boasted itself like Nebuchadnezzar.
Nevertheless, in this age, so glorious in
its own conceit, so fruitful in many respects, one rank
weed had been suffered to grow up unchecked, till it
poisoned the breathing-room of the human spirit.</p>

<p>The name of this weed was Cant.</p>

<p>The Victorian world had been satirized unconsciously
by the Victorian poet. In his &#8220;Idylls of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
King&#8221; Tennyson had depicted a man without passions
trying to impose his own cold virtues on men of
warmer temperament, and producing first hypocrisy
and deceit, and in the end a deeper corruption. The
Victorian world had been like Arthur&#8217;s Court.</p>

<p>In this world Cant became a religion, and hypocrisy
was enforced by law. It was a world whose
literature and art were adjusted to the mental and
moral level of the Sunday-school. It was a world
in which a terrible disease, bred of moral corruption,
scourged the race, and every effort to stay its ravages
was fought against tooth and nail by the m&aelig;nads
of social purity. It was a world in which selfishness
was inculcated in a million sermons, and slander and
persecution were reckoned as good works. It was a
world in which blackmailing became a recognized profession.
It was a world in which men sent sailors
to be drowned in rotten ships, and built chapels with
the proceeds. It was a world which overthrew kings
and set up millionaire monopolists; which suppressed
slavery and invented sweating; which substituted the
prostitute for the concubine; which imposed a curfew
on beer at home and sold opium abroad at the point
of the bayonet. A great pirate Empire ravaged the
seas, with a crucifix at the masthead, and stole pagan
continents.</p>

<p>One night when Alistair Stuart went round to the
house in Chestnut-Tree Walk he found its master
waiting for him in a state of excited expectation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you heard the news?&#8221; Des Louvres asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
in a whisper, as soon as Stuart had sat down. &#8220;They
are trying to keep it out of the papers as long as possible,
but it has reached me from a source that I can
absolutely depend upon. Queen Victoria is dying.&#8221;</p>

<small>HIGH TREASON</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">I have</span> my information from a person in the confidence
of one of the Royal Family. The Queen cannot
last more than three days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stuart had received the news with a slight shock.
For him, as for all his generation, the venerable figure
seated on the throne had almost a legendary character.
It seemed impossible to think of the British
Empire without Queen Victoria; the idea of a new
head on the coins and postage-stamps was strange and
incredible.</p>

<p>But, apart from these reflections the Frenchman&#8217;s
announcement did not strike him as having any importance
for himself, and he was unable to understand
the excitement with which Des Louvres took him by
the arm and drew him towards the door of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most of the others are here,&#8221; Des Louvres said
in a voice lowered to a whisper. &#8220;I telegraphed to
them as soon as I heard. They are in there, waiting
for you to take the chair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then for the first time it struck Alistair that the
approaching demise of the Crown was an event likely
to prove a crisis, and that Des Louvres expected him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
to play a part in keeping with his ancestral traditions
and outlawed state.</p>

<p>Nothing loth, he passed into the room where the
committee was assembled, the strongest feeling in his
mind one of amusement at the thought of the terror
likely to be excited in the bosom of the Chevalier
Vane and his brother at the prospect of a serious
collision with the authorities.</p>

<p>He found the Chevalier inside, looking pale and
anxious, while Wickham&#8217;s face bore the calmer expression
of one whose mind was made up. Mr. St.
Maur was also present, looking little less comfortable
than the Chevalier, and the party was reinforced by
the Hon. Gerald St. John and Mr. Basil Dyke. The
Decadents were complete, with the one exception of
Mendes, whose complaisance had never extended to
the length of enrolling himself among the comrades
or followers of the Comte des Louvres.</p>

<p>Stuart had scarcely seated himself when Egerton
Vane rose precipitately to his feet, to explain his
position.</p>

<p>Des Louvres had cruelly refrained from assigning
anything more definite than &#8220;important business&#8221; as
the object of the meeting; and when on their arrival
they learned the character of the crisis, the brothers
felt themselves entrapped. This was the moment of
all others when they would have wished the Guild
to practise the modesty of self-effacement; and if the
Guild was going, on the contrary, to do anything
rash, it was the moment which they would have chosen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
silently to sever their connection with the Guild.
They knew better than the Frenchman the sentiment
entertained by her subjects towards the dying Queen,
and they had no desire to face the storm that would
be provoked by any demonstration of disrespect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our secretary has called us together rather hastily,&#8221;
the Chevalier began in a plaintive tone. &#8220;No
doubt the news he has received is very important, if
it is reliable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is absolutely reliable,&#8221; interrupted the Count.</p>

<p>The Chevalier drew a laboured sigh, as he resumed:
&#8220;In that case, whatever our political views
may be, I am sure we shall all feel that at such a moment
we must share to a certain extent in the national
mourning for the loss of a venerated and respected&mdash;er&mdash;personage.
I am not sure that our secretary
has acted altogether discreetly&mdash;though of course he
meant it for the best&mdash;in summoning a meeting of
the Guild at such a moment; but as we are here, I
suggest that it would be a graceful act on our part
to pass a resolution recording our&mdash;er&mdash;respect and&mdash;er&mdash;sympathy
with the family of the&mdash;er&mdash;the
Queen!&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker brought out the last word with a defiant
jerk, and sat down hastily, hoping to evade a
rebuke at the hands of Des Louvres. But he was
agreeably surprised to see that astute schemer rise
and second his proposition. The French Count had
the sense to interpret the situation rightly, and to
see that the fears of a man like Egerton Vane were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
a useful index to the state of English opinion. Evidently
it would be wise to propitiate the public sentiment
by such a resolution as Vane had suggested.</p>

<p>The Chevalier had the gratification of seeing his
proposition carried unanimously. But this concession
made to policy, Des Louvres lost no time in coming
to business.</p>

<p>&#8220;In three days from now the throne will be vacant,
and the Guild will have to show whether it is capable
of taking action in accordance with its principles.
Since the successful rebellion of 1688 no usurping
Sovereign has ever been allowed to ascend the throne
without a protest being made on behalf of the legitimate
heirs. On this occasion it is clearly our duty
to make that protest, and the only question is how
we should proceed.&#8221;</p>

<p>This bold challenge was received in chilling silence.
Stuart glanced round the room with a disdain he
hardly tried to conceal, and saw one after the other
shrink back.</p>

<p>Without rising from his seat, St. John put a question
to the secretary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has the Princess been consulted?&#8221;</p>

<p>Des Louvres shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her Majesty&#8217;s position is a difficult one,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;As a German Princess she is exposed to
pressure from Berlin. We cannot expect her to give
us any open countenance. As long as she does not
publicly repudiate us, that is as much as we have any
right to ask.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>After a silence full of eloquence, the waverers
found a champion in Mr. Basil Dyke. The novelist
was on the eve of completing his reconciliation with
the <i>bourgeoisie</i> by marriage with a lady whose father&#8217;s
liver pills enjoyed a celebrity such as literature
cannot attain, although it was part of the understanding
that in the future Mr. Dyke&#8217;s productions were
to be recommended in the same organs of publicity
as his father-in-law&#8217;s. The reformed Decadent looked
forward to entering the House of Commons in the
character of a supporter of Church and Throne; and
with such a prospect in view it was evidently time
for him to dissociate himself from the political profligacies
of his youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot agree with the Comte des Louvres that
we have any right to speak on behalf of the Princess,
without her express authority,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Neither
do I see what we have to gain by coming forward at
this particular time. We have proclaimed our principles,
the public is aware of them, and any assertion
of them at this moment would be taken badly. It
would be said that we were guilty of bad taste&mdash;that
we were advertising ourselves on the occasion of a
funeral.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair smiled. It seemed to him very English,
this unctuous horror of advertisement on the part of
a man who had won notoriety with a treacherous libel
and was about to confirm it by an alliance with liver
pills. Basil Dyke was clearly marked out for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
knighthood under the new reign. He was one of
those whom England delights to honor.</p>

<p>There was no doubt that the novelist had on his
side the majority of those present. The disappointed
Count vainly tried to strike a responsive chord.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the Guild for, if it is not to act at a crisis
like this?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>The Hon. Gerald St. John gave him his answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;Our mission is to educate, not to indulge in vulgar
demonstrations, like Socialists and people of that
kind. For my part I have never pretended to take
any interest in Mary III. My quarrel is with respectability
and I shall wait to see whether the new Court
is respectable before I condemn it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Des Louvres bit his lip. &#8220;You English are always
respectable,&#8221; he sneered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; was the good-tempered answer. &#8220;Our
middle class is always respectable, I grant you; but
our aristocracy is generally wicked. And we have
had lots of disreputable Kings. I have every hope
that the Victorian Age will be succeeded by a
Restoration.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Charles II. was a Stuart,&#8221; protested the Legitimist
agent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if it comes to that, I don&#8217;t know that your
German Princess is any more of a Stuart than the
people in possession. There seems to me very little
to choose between Bavaria and Saxe-Coburg. George
IV. was a man with many fine qualities.&#8221;</p>

<p>Des Louvres began to lose his temper.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>&#8220;Of course, if anybody is afraid of the consequences
I don&#8217;t expect them to come forward,&#8221; he said
sneeringly.</p>

<p>The insult that cannot be pardoned is the one that
we feel to be deserved. Egerton Vane, St. Maur,
and the bridegroom-elect rose to their feet together.</p>

<p>&#8220;After that I shall go home. Come, Wickham,&#8221;
cried the Chevalier. Mr. St. Maur was understood
to mutter that if anything did happen the Comte des
Louvres would probably be the first out of the country.
Dyke inquired whether a foreigner was qualified
to dictate to Englishmen their line of conduct at
a national crisis.</p>

<p>The hubbub was subdued by the chairman&#8217;s voice.
Alistair had been bored by the debate, much as a boy
fresh from his first term at school is bored by the
forgotten interests of the nursery. He felt that he
had outgrown all this kind of thing; it was wide of
the mark; it led nowhere, and promised nothing. But
he was in just that mood when action of any kind
offered a temptation which it was impossible to resist,
and he felt a keen pleasure in asserting himself for
the last time among those who had been his followers
for so long.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before Des Louvres talks about being afraid, suppose
he tells us what he wants us to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>The mutterings of strife died down, and all eyes
were turned on the Count. His response was ready
instantly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>&#8220;I consider the Guild ought to issue a formal Assertion
of the right of Queen Mary III. to the throne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you got the Assertion there?&#8221;</p>

<p>Des Louvres produced it, and read it aloud. It
was received in dead silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Alistair, &#8220;what next? What do you
want to do with that thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It ought to be posted up all over London, the
moment the death of the Queen is announced.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is to post it up?&#8221;</p>

<p>This time Des Louvres had no answer ready. He
glanced doubtfully round the uneasy faces of his colleagues,
and drew his own conclusions. Dyke could
not resist a sneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely that is the secretary&#8217;s duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Frenchman was stung into accepting the
challenge.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will post up one if everyone else will do the
same,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The chairman looked slowly round him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree to put up one,&#8221; he said deliberately.</p>

<p>There was another silence, during which the two
Vanes consulted each other&#8217;s countenances. The same
thought had occurred to each. What was to prevent
them from taking a copy of the treasonable document
and discreetly disposing of it in private?</p>

<p>The Hon. Gerald St. John shrugged his shoulders.
&#8220;If Stuart is going to post one up, I shall do the same,
though I don&#8217;t agree with it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>The Chevalier Vane rose to his feet with considerable
emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me a copy, and I will do my duty,&#8221; he said
sublimely. &#8220;I answer for my brother as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. St. Maur had meanwhile been deciding on his
private course of action. Convinced that the present
proceedings must be taken seriously by the authorities,
he had resolved to earn his own pardon by a
whole-souled repentance. He lowered his eyes to the
ground, as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;For my part I am compelled to dissociate myself
from this manifesto at such a time. I desire that
my protest may be recorded in the minutes of the
Guild.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Chevalier and his brother exchanged alarmed
glances. The idea that their courageous undertaking
might be recorded in writing had not occurred to
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely there will be no record taken of to-night&#8217;s
meeting!&#8221; Egerton exclaimed. &#8220;These proceedings
are confidential!&#8221;</p>

<p>Des Louvres hastened to reassure him. He had
conceived a suspicion from St. Maur&#8217;s manner, and
determined to balk him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in the hands of the committee,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;But in my opinion it will be best to make no entry
beyond the names of those present, and to state that
the proceedings were of a private character.&#8221;</p>

<p>Basil Dyke sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case I shall withdraw at once!&#8221; he declared.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
&#8220;I consider you had no right to bring us
here without warning us of what you were going to
propose. This is high treason. I shall resign my
membership of the Guild.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I move that Mr. Dyke&#8217;s resignation be accepted,&#8221;
said Alistair swiftly, going through the necessary
formalities, as the irate novelist made his way to the
door.</p>

<p>Wickham Vane cast a reproachful glance at his
brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;If there is going to be any record of to-night&#8217;s
meeting, I shall go as well,&#8221; he announced.</p>

<p>Des Louvres saw that he must give way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have it as you please,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;As I said,
I am in your hands.&#8221; Then, with a warning glance
in St. Maur&#8217;s direction, he added: &#8220;That concludes
the business of the meeting. Those who have undertaken
to post up copies of the Assertion had better
remain behind to consult as to the most appropriate
places.&#8221;</p>

<p>The informer was obliged to take the hint.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, gentlemen,&#8221; he said, as he rose to go.
&#8220;Remember that if this lands you in trouble, I have
done my best to save you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That fellow means to betray us,&#8221; said Des Louvres,
as the door closed behind the Irishman. &#8220;He
will turn King&#8217;s evidence if the police get on our
track.&#8221;</p>

<p>Egerton Vane turned white. But stealing a look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
at his brother, he was reassured by the placid expression
that stole over Wickham&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>In the discussion that followed it was settled that
Stuart should put up the manifesto at the most important
spot&mdash;the gallery of St. James&#8217;s Palace, from
which the new Sovereign is wont to be proclaimed.
The others selected other points about the Metropolis,
and Des Louvres undertook to post copies to
members of the Guild in the provinces, with instructions
to affix them to the church doors. The secretary
possessed a typing machine, and each of the volunteers
was in possession of his copy as he came
away.</p>

<p>Alistair strolled home slowly, to find his wife in a
state of some excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know what is happening?&#8221; she asked
eagerly, as he came in. &#8220;The Queen is dying.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair stared at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, is it in the papers already?&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>It was Molly&#8217;s turn to stare.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you knew it? Who told you? Oh, of
course, that man Des Louvres.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who told you?&#8221; demanded Alistair. He noticed
that Molly was rouged to the eyebrows, and that she
had been drinking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Mendes told me,&#8221; she said in a hard, defiant
voice. &#8220;He called here just after you had gone. He
wants us to go and dine with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can go if you like,&#8221; Alistair said listlessly.</p>

<p>The dinner with Mendes took place three nights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
afterwards. It was given in London&#8217;s most expensive
restaurant, and Lord and Lady Alistair were the
only guests. Mendes was as cool and composed as
ever, chatting with his guests as if no interruption had
ever occurred in their intercourse. Molly was voluble
and restless, emptying her glass as often as the
waiter filled it with champagne. Alistair ate and
drank little, and hardly spoke except when his host
addressed to him a direct question. He felt strangely
out of place, as he sat there, looking abstractedly from
one to the other of his companions, and wondering
what he was doing there between them, and how it
was all going to end.</p>

<p>Suddenly, just as the sweets were being brought
round, there was a stir outside, and a man came in
hurriedly with a sheaf of papers under his arm. He
went through the long, brilliantly lit saloon, leaving
a paper on each little table, and as he approached
Mendes he said in his ear in a subdued voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Queen is dead, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair slowly filled his own glass with wine, lifted
it up, and emptied it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the end of an age,&#8221; he said, as he set it down
again, and rose deliberately to his feet.</p>

<p>Mendes glanced at him curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is the end of some things,&#8221; he answered
composedly. &#8220;Are you off?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have an engagement,&#8221; said Alistair dryly.</p>

<p>The two men shook hands quietly, but not without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
cordiality. Each of them had found something in
the other to respect.</p>

<p>Alistair was leaving without bestowing more than
a nod on Molly, when she surprised him by getting
up.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want me?&#8221; she said, with the husky
accent which came into her voice when she had been
drinking a good deal.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Alistair, puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>She held out a beringed hand, and Alistair took it
nervously, inly afraid of a scene. Then he went without
looking back.</p>

<p>It was midnight before he let himself into the little
art kitchen in Beers Cooperage, and saw by the light
of the match which he had struck to show him the
way upstairs a white envelope lying on the floor. The
flap bore the printed name of the hotel in which he
had dined that night, and he tore it open, with a sensation
of knowing all about it, and having expected it
all along.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Alistair</span>&#8221; (said the shaky, badly-formed
writing within), &#8220;It is no good. You don&#8217;t want me,
and it will never be any better. I have gone abroad
with Mr. Mendes, and you can get a divorce as soon
as you like.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Molly Finucane.</span></p>

<small>A PERSONAL EXPLANATION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great Puritan Queen lay dead&mdash;dead, after
sixty-three years of unexampled prosperity and glory.
For her, and in her name, heroes had conquered and
statesmen had annexed; laureates had hymned her in
exquisite verse; discoverers had written her name on
the map of new continents and carried it to the mysterious
sources of old Nile. On her the farthest East
had showered barbaric pearl and gold, and new
realms had come forth out of the desert to hail her
Queen.</p>

<p>The last Protestant Queen lay dead. And before
the warmth of life had ebbed away two hands were
lifted to rend the veil of the world&#8217;s reverence. One
of these hands affixed a paper to her Palace walls,
proclaiming that she had been a usurper; the other
boasted in the public press that she had been interred
with a Catholic emblem upon her breast.</p>

<p>Both hands were guided, consciously or unconsciously,
by the same motive power. Both actions
were symbolical. The mysterious process of the rise
and fall of nations is worked out by and through
the change of minds. The Victorian Age had passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
away before Victoria herself. And her end had been
hastened and embittered by the opening revelations
of the anti-Puritan war.</p>

<p>The last man in England who was likely to read
aright the signs of the times, and perceive the true
trend of contemporary history was the man who,
naturally enough, found himself occupying the post
of Home Secretary.</p>

<p>The Duke of Trent had been passing the last two
days at Osborne, in obedience to the archaic custom
which required him to witness the Sovereign&#8217;s demise.
Not less archaic in essence seemed to his eye
the seditious manifesto which was brought to him by
an agent of Scotland Yard, torn down from St.
James&#8217;s Palace within half an hour of its being put
up. Viewing it, as his character and intellectual limitations
compelled him to view it, as an offensive practical
joke, nevertheless he hastened back to town in
a state of uneasiness bordering on alarm. He did
not, of course, apprehend anything in the nature of
violence, but he thought it quite possible that the
authors of the Assertion might be preparing to interrupt
the formal proclamation of the new Sovereign;
and he had ordered the ceremony to be deferred till
the police had had time to act.</p>

<p>Privately he had another and still more serious
cause of anxiety. He had not forgotten the Legitimist
bazaar, and he feared that the investigations
which had been immediately set on foot might show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
the name of his brother as figuring among the authors
of the disgraceful jest.</p>

<p>The task of the police did not prove a difficult
one. Late in the afternoon of the day after the outrage
the Chief Commissioner himself waited upon
the Secretary of State at the Home Office to make his
confidential report.</p>

<p>The Duke received him alone, with an air of embarrassment
which the Commissioner found it easy
to understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought it best to come to your Grace myself,
as the matter is one that seems to call for careful
handling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you found out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The manifesto&mdash;they call it the Assertion&mdash;comes
from the committee of a body styling itself the Legitimist
Guild. The real instigator, I suspect, is a
Frenchman, the Comte des Louvres, who is a sort of
international agent. He is in the pay of the Duke
of &mdash;&mdash;, the King of the &mdash;&mdash;, and even, I believe, of
the Vatican.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Home Secretary frowned.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was his motive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Simply to show that he was earning his money,
I expect. There may be some idea that if they can
give trouble to our Royal Family, the influence of
the English Court will be exerted on behalf of the
Royalist cause in France&mdash;or the Pope&#8217;s temporal
power.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what have you done?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>&#8220;We had very little to do. As soon as the manifesto
was found I guessed whom it came from, and
sent a couple of detectives round to the Count&#8217;s house,
where they seized the papers of the Guild. That
seems to have frightened them, and within an hour
or two more than half of the committee were round
with us volunteering information, and anxious to be
accepted as King&#8217;s evidence in case of a prosecution.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke raised his eyes to the Commissioner&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;The King does not want a prosecution. He prefers
that the whole thing should be hushed up. All
we have to do is to give these fools a good fright, so
that they will think twice before repeating their exploit.
What are their names?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The first men who came to us were two brothers
named Vane, who had undertaken to post up copies
of the Assertion themselves, but thought better of
it&mdash;they brought the copies with them to prove their
innocence. Afterwards there was an Irishman who
calls himself St. Maur, but whose real name is Maher,
and Basil Dyke, the novelist. Dyke seems to have
protested the whole thing from the first, and resigned
from the Guild in consequence. I don&#8217;t think any
of the four are likely to give any more trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who else is there?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Commissioner of Police discreetly turned his
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only others are the Comte des Louvres, the
Hon. Gerald St. John, and&mdash;Lord Alistair Stuart.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>Lord Alistair&#8217;s brother clenched the hand that
rested on the desk in front of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; that is what I expected.&#8221; He paused for
a moment or two, frowning and fidgeting in his chair.
&#8220;Who put up this wretched thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;According to the Vanes, Lord Alistair must have
posted the one on the Palace. The other two were
each to put up one somewhere else, but I believe Mr.
St. John was the only one who actually did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In other words, my brother is the ringleader&mdash;is
that so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think his lordship is the only one of the whole
crew who has any pluck,&#8221; was the response. &#8220;He
was in the chair when the thing was decided on.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke of Trent drew his lips together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know where to find him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have men watching them all. Lord Alistair
has stayed indoors all day.&#8221; The Chief Commissioner
hesitated, and then went on. &#8220;Your Grace will
excuse me if I refer to a private matter which perhaps
you would wish to hear at once. Lady Alistair
has deserted his lordship&mdash;eloped, in fact, with Mr.
Mendes, the millionaire.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke looked up, startled.</p>

<p>&#8220;When did that happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yesterday, I understand. She did not come home
last night. His lordship has been alone all day.&#8221;</p>

<p>James Stuart fell into a brown study. The news
he had just heard was both good and bad. It was
a relief to know that he would not remain much longer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
the brother-in-law of Molly Finucane; but on the
other hand he saw his brother resuming the position
of a rival for the hand of Hero Vanbrugh. With
the cold obstinacy of his nature, James still clung persistently
to the belief that sooner or later he would
obtain the woman on whom he had set his heart&mdash;or
what he deemed to be his heart. But now the obstacle
that had stood between Hero and his brother
had been removed, and unless he could replace it by
another, even his dull mind could perceive how things
were likely to go.</p>

<p>He fixed his eyes once more upon his official
subordinate.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you have told me, Commissioner, alters my
position. If my brother is the person principally
guilty, I cannot honourably be responsible for advising
His Majesty to let the affair be hushed up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Commissioner bowed low, deeply impressed
by the scrupulous delicacy of his superior.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are your Grace&#8217;s instructions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The law must take its course&mdash;for the present, at
all events. Of course, I shall communicate again
with His Majesty, and with the Prime Minister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case I shall have to arrest his lordship as
well as the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be sufficient if you arrest Lord Alistair.
You can give the others a chance to escape abroad.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Chief Commissioner stood for a moment, playing
awkwardly with his hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;In cases of high treason,&#8221; he observed, in a low<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
voice, &#8220;it is customary for the warrant to be signed
by the Home Secretary.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Home Secretary drew himself up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you a warrant with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The necessary form was procured from the criminal
branch of the Department, and James wrote his
own name beneath that of his only brother, with a
firm, unfaltering hand.</p>

<p>The next hour was taken up by the Commissioner
of Police in personally effecting the arrest of his distinguished
prisoner, and by the Secretary of State in
communicating with the head of the Government.
The Duke went through the form of tendering his
resignation, which was courteously declined.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not believe for a moment that His Majesty
will reconsider his decision, nor should I advise it,&#8221;
the old Prime Minister said sensibly. &#8220;You had better
cancel the warrant at once. Give your brother
a good fright and send him out of the country. Let
us hope that this experience may sober him.&#8221;</p>

<p>When James got back to the Home Office he found
a note on his desk from the Chief Commissioner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have his lordship in the next room, but he is
hardly in a fit condition to be questioned. Perhaps
your Grace had better see him to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke rang his bell, and ordered his brother
to be brought before him alone.</p>

<p>Alistair came in, still wearing the evening dress in
which he had dined with Mendes overnight, with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
hair unbrushed and his eyes from an unreposeful
sleep.</p>

<p>His brother glanced at him with carefully concealed
anxiety; for though he was scarcely aware of it himself,
he was always a little afraid of Alistair. It
was a relief to see that his brother was not apparently
intoxicated: the reckless mood which James
dreaded most had given place to one of depression.
At such a moment Alistair might be spoken to seriously;
he might even be reproved without the risk
of unpleasant retorts.</p>

<p>The prisoner, without going through any form of
greeting to his brother, dropped into one of the great
spreading leather-covered chairs which stood round
the wall and waited for Trent to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it any use asking you why you have done this?&#8221;
Trent said, after regarding him in silence for some
time.</p>

<p>Alistair turned on him a lack-lustre eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are asking me as Secretary of State, perhaps
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Home Secretary fidgeted with the papers on
the writing-table in front of him. It was a favourite
trick of his when he was embarrassed. Indeed, he
generally kept a pile of papers in front of him on
purpose. A little consideration told him that it was
not worth while to try to bluff Alistair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no, I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have arrested me, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221; The prisoner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
made his point quietly, as though moved by a
quite impersonal curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; The Duke hesitated again, and again decided
that the bluffing policy would be too risky.
&#8220;Since I signed the warrant, I&#8217;ve seen the Prime Minister.
I tendered him my resignation, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair began to look ever so little interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never thought you would do that,&#8221; he confessed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose you thought anything about it,
one way or the other,&#8221; Trent retorted, with some
bitterness. &#8220;You never do think of me&mdash;or your
mother&mdash;do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The prisoner straightened himself up for an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. It is difficult not to think of one&#8217;s enemies
sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Honest astonishment came into Trent&#8217;s look and
mien.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enemies! Your mother and I! What do you
mean? If I were to call you my enemy, I should
have some reason. The worst enmity I have ever
shown you has been to give you a thousand a year,
and to offer to pay your debts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, on conditions,&#8221; Alistair reminded him. But
he did not speak with any appearance of resentment.
The elder brother&#8217;s warmth had failed to rouse any
answering warmth in the younger.</p>

<p>&#8220;On conditions which, as you must now admit, were
for your own good. At least, I suppose that you
are not prepared to defend that wretched woman any
longer.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; Alistair had nearly sprung out of his
chair. &#8220;Say whatever you like about me, I shan&#8217;t
resent it; but leave Molly alone, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trent looked as bewildered as he felt.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>Alistair cut him short.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know she has just done the greatest thing that
any woman can do for a man. She loved me, she was
married to me, she saw that I loved another woman,
and she has deliberately set me free to marry her.
By heavens! I should like to know how many of
your Christian women would do as much as that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Trent was staggered. Like the Duchess, he had
overlooked the fact that Molly Finucane was really
an ally. Perhaps, if they had been wiser, Lady Alistair
might have been made to take a different view
of the situation in the past. But now it was too
late.</p>

<p>He dared not risk a direct question about Hero.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you can&#8217;t marry anyone else yet,&#8221; he said,
not very delicately. &#8220;The question is, what are you
going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it what are you going to do? I am still
under arrest, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trent fell back on his papers again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you I had seen the Prime Minister. He
is willing to let the matter be hushed up, out of consideration
for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>After all, he had ventured on a bluff; and, after
all, it did not come off. Alistair merely smiled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>&#8220;I am not a fool, Trent, you know. I have never
seriously supposed that I ran any danger of being
hanged, drawn and quartered. So the resignation has
been withdrawn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was declined,&#8221; the Minister corrected. &#8220;But
if the papers get hold of the business, I shall have to
go&mdash;for a time, at all events.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair seemed genuinely concerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really? I should be sorry if it was so bad as
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trent gazed at him sullenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you see that everything you do is bad for
me? Somehow or other you seem bent on wrecking
my career as well as your own. First bankruptcy,
then that marriage; now, I suppose, divorce&mdash;and this
disgraceful outrage on the top of everything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair was surprisingly meek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I dare say you feel it is rather rough on you;
but, after all, no one can blame you for my misdeeds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they do&mdash;they must. You don&#8217;t suppose I
could remain Home Secretary with my own brother
doing time in one of the prisons under my control.
You just called me your enemy; I should like to know
what you are to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could tell you that, if I thought you would understand,&#8221;
the other said in low tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have I done, what has our mother done,
that you should make no effort to spare us all this
disgrace?&#8221; Trent demanded warmly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>&#8220;Ah! what have you done? Have you ever considered
me?&#8221; returned Alistair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Considered you? We have done nothing else.
We have always been trying to save you, but you
have never let us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Save me!&mdash;yes, I suppose that is how you would
put it to yourself. You have been trying to save me
from disgracing you, as you call it. Has it ever occurred
to either of you that the whole of our joint
lives has been one long persecution of me by you,
Trent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Persecution! What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to tell you what I mean. I dare say
I shall never have another opportunity. We are not
likely to see much more of one another. I am going
abroad.&#8221;</p>

<p>The unexpected announcement on his brother&#8217;s part
that he was preparing to take the very step that Trent
almost despaired of making him take was so welcome
that the Duke found himself listening patiently to
what followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever asked yourself why I am different
from you&mdash;why I lead a different life from the one
you lived? To begin with, you are the Duke of Trent
and Colonsay; I am a younger son. Do you blame
me for that? Do you blame me for not being a Duke,
like you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not. It is nonsense to suggest it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think it is nonsense. On the contrary,
I think a great many people in your position blame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>
people in mine. Not in so many words, perhaps,
but in their whole attitude towards them. You blame
a man for not being a gentleman when you call him
a cad. But if he was born a cad, what fault is it of
his? Every time we who are well born boast of our
good blood, surely we are blaming the people who
had the bad luck to be born without pedigrees. And
yet we cannot all belong to the Royal Family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not aware that I ever put on side on account
of my family,&#8221; protested Trent.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But you would be very much surprised and
offended if a tradesman offered to shake hands with
you over the counter. Let us pass on. You have
nearly forty thousand a year; I am a pauper. You
must admit that you have blamed me for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I? Never! I have blamed you for spending
more than your allowance, that is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t see it, of course. But the whole life
of a man like you is a reproach to one like me. You
blame me for buying things that you would not blame
a rich man for buying. It is a crime on my part to
drive a motor; it is no crime on yours. And you go
much farther than that, because you tell me, in effect,
that I ought to be rich. In England every rich man
is telling that to every poor man all day long. It is
the cry of the press and the pulpit, of the home and
of the Sunday-school. Every millionaire is angry
with the man who is not a millionaire. Why? They
tell us that we could become millionaires like them if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
we chose; and it is a lie. We cannot all be millionaires.
There are not enough millions to go round.
The millionaire himself has gained his money at
someone else&#8217;s expense. You have gained your money
at my expense. Instead of the inheritance being divided,
you have it all. If I am not angry with you
on that account, why should you be angry with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not angry,&#8221; Trent protested again. But he
began to feel a little shaken.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we all became millionaires,&#8221; Alistair continued
calmly, &#8220;you who are millionaires already would
be the first to suffer. You would have no servants
to wait on you, no labourers to toil for you, no clerks
to make and keep your millions for you. Surely it
is to your interest that a large part of mankind should
remain poor. Then why be angry with them on account
of their poverty? Why despise them for serving
you? If you like robbing, why abuse those who
let themselves be robbed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does this mean that you are going to turn Socialist?&#8221;
asked the puzzled Duke.</p>

<p>Alistair smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you see that it means the very opposite? It
is you who are the Socialist&mdash;yes, you&mdash;because it
is you who will not tolerate the individual. You
have never tolerated me. You have always been trying,
as you put it, to reform me. And what do you
mean by reforming me? You mean crushing me out
of my natural shape and into your natural shape. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
believe that all men ought to resemble each other like
buttons on a coat&mdash;and you are the pattern button.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trent made no answer. In his heart he felt that
he was the pattern button, and that Alistair ought to
try to resemble him. But he feared his brother&#8217;s sarcastic
tongue too much to say so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Alistair continued. &#8220;I am sure it has
never occurred to you that I ought to dye my hair the
same shade as yours, though men stooped even to that
depth in the days of Louis Quatorze. You have just
admitted that I am not really to blame for having
been born after you, or because you have my share of
the property. Then why blame me because my tastes
are different from yours&mdash;because I prefer poetry to
politics, and Bohemia to Philistia?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not a matter of taste only. The common
rules of morality are the same for all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why should they be the same? Who made
the rules? You&#8221;&mdash;he pointed an accusing finger&mdash;&#8220;you,
and men like you. When you say morality,
you mean monogamy. Who set up monogamy as the
idol that all the human race ought to fall down and
worship? It was not religion&mdash;there is not a word
in favour of monogamy in the Bible. It is an Anglo-Saxon
fad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, if you repudiate the laws of morality,
I cannot argue with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not arguing. I am trying to make you understand.
I want to see if it isn&#8217;t possible to stop all
this cruelty&mdash;this frantic Puritan craze for killing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>
everybody who isn&#8217;t a Wesleyan. I don&#8217;t want to kill
you. I don&#8217;t mind your being respectable; why should
you mind my being disreputable? What business is
it of yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget that you are my brother, and that I
suffer for your conduct.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alistair shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t true, Trent, and you know it isn&#8217;t true.
Here you are, Secretary of State, with the Garter in
prospect, and a very fair chance of the Premiership,
if no man with brains comes along. If I ever were
to reform, as you are always urging me to do, and go
into politics, you would find me a rather dangerous
rival, you know.&#8221; Trent thought of Hero, and
winced. There was something in what his brother
was saying. Alistair, in the House of Commons, with
his fascinating manner and sparkling wit, would be
a rather dangerous rival. And he had never seen it,
never realized that their mother&#8217;s anxiety to make
Alistair enter the House might be another of those
projects to save the younger son at the expense of the
elder. While these reflections were passing through
his slow mind, Alistair was still speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Trent, it is the other way about. I don&#8217;t
suppose that you will ever see it, but I see it now.
Instead of your suffering for me, it is I who suffer
for you. You owe everything you are, and have, and
may be, to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How on earth can you say that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I am the younger son&mdash;the younger son<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>
in more senses than one. The law gives you the
dukedom and the estates, and gives me nothing, is
a law which makes me suffer for your benefit. And
it is the same with all the other laws under which
we live. They are all laws made in your favour at
my expense. The whole social system has been created
to favour you and oppress me. The laws of
morality, as you call them, they are all made by men
like you, and against men like me. You have regulated
the world to suit yourself, and the man whom
your regulations do not suit is sacrificed to secure your
happiness. Yes, it is just like the old days when they
buried a victim under the foundation stone, to make
the building safe. You and your world, society, civilization,
the British Empire&mdash;call it what you like&mdash;you
are the builders, and it is the building; and all
we whom you hang and exile and imprison&mdash;Jacobites
in one century and anarchists in another, Byron and
Shelley above, and the pickpocket and drunkard below&mdash;all
we are the foundation victims, whom you
sacrifice in order to secure your State.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trent felt out of his depth. In his confusion of
mind he said the most unwise thing he could have
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You speak as though there were no such thing as
religion. What you are really attacking is Christianity.
You are not a Christian.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Alistair looked at him gravely and steadily,
and the thought that had been growing and taking
shape in his mind ever since the night he had stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>
on Westminster Bridge came out firm and distinct
at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a christ!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alistair!&#8221; Genuine consternation showed in the
listener&#8217;s face and voice. He actually feared that his
brother was out of his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am your christ. Listen! It is not only the
dukedom and the estates that have come to us from
our ancestors. We have inherited other things&mdash;blood,
instincts, passions, everything that makes the
difference between one man and another. And that
inheritance has been unfairly divided, too. Our forefathers
were half Saxon and half Celtic. You have
inherited the Saxon strain, and I the Celtic; and we
live in a society in which it is well to be a Saxon,
and ill to be a Celt. Our father was a drunkard and
our mother a Puritan. You take after her and I after
him, and we live in a world in which it is well with
the Puritan and ill with the drunkard. Some of our
forefathers were steady, plodding money-gatherers,
others were wild, reckless adventurers. Again you
have inherited the good strain, and I the bad. You
have had everything, Trent. Everything which the
world requires a man to be or to do, you are, or it
is your nature to do. All that the world forbids a
man to be and do, I am, or it is my nature to do. It
is as though a breeder had deliberately bred you with
all the good points and me with all the bad. You
know what Sir Bernard Vanbrugh thinks about these
things. What did he tell you?&mdash;that you had inherited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>
an evil strain? The man was blind. I have inherited
the evil strain, and by so doing I have saved
you from it; I have carried it off from you, like a
drainpipe. That is how it is. I am your saviour.
Vanbrugh doesn&#8217;t see it, but Darwinism and Christianity
are saying the same thing. Evolution is the sacrifice
of the unfit on behalf of the fit. The scapegoat
bears away the sins of the righteous. They were
quite right to put up a crucifix in the old Courts of
Justice, but it ought to have been over the dock, and
not over the Judge&#8217;s head, because the criminal is the
christ; he is the redeemer in whom the old vices and
savage instincts in the blood of mankind are drained
off and got rid of, for the salvation of the world. You
may substitute the lethal chamber for the cross, but
you will be still doing what those old Jews were doing,
putting one man to death for the good of the
people. Surely that is how it stands between you and
me, Jim. Surely I have borne your sicknesses, and
carried your pains, whereas you did esteem me stricken,
smitten of God, and afflicted. But I was pierced
for your transgressions, I was bruised for your iniquities:
the chastisement on behalf of your peace was
upon me; and with my stripes you are healed.&#8221;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Isle de St. Pierre, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
&#8220;Lac De Bienne, &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
&#8220;Switzerland.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My Dear One</span>:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am writing to you from an island in the least
known of the Swiss lakes, lying beneath the Jura.
The island is the size of a small farm. It is crossed
by a thickly-wooded ridge, and there are reed-grown
marshes on one side, and on the other meadows and
gardens and a homely inn. The inn has grown out
of an older cottage or farmhouse, and certain rooms
in the more ancient part of the building have become
a place of local pilgrimage. On Sundays and holidays
the workmen of the small neighbouring towns come
here to drink and dance. But the foreign tourist is
more rarely seen here, and the English tourist would
most likely shun the spot if he had heard of it. For
these rude quarters were the refuge, more than a
hundred years ago, of a man who, more or less
against his will, lit the great bonfire of the feudal
system.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was during one of those breaks in his life when,
like Jonah of old, he seemed to be trying to flee from
his allotted task, that Rousseau came and hid himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>
for this little isle. But the feudal society craved
for destruction, and, like all societies in that condition,
it first bred its destroyer and then steadily goaded
him to the work. The young Marat, from his
home a few miles away, must have looked on while
the prophet of the Revolution was being hunted out
of this retreat by the Prussian police, and, as it were,
ordered to resume his terrible apostolate.</p>

<p>&#8220;If imagination were possible for public bodies,
if gratitude were conceivable on the part of the Socialist
democracy, this isle would not be turned into
a restaurant for bank-holiday workmen. It would
be made a fit memorial of Rousseau by being set apart
for the benefit of his heirs. Every man of genius,
driven like him into exile by poverty and love of
freedom, would find here a retreat in which he could
rest from the storms of the world. Or if stupidity
were not the curse of gold, the millionaires themselves
would raise a voluntary tax to build an alms-house
for Rousseau and Marat, instead of flogging
them on to the work of anarchy with the sharp goads
of hunger and contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I find that my brother&#8217;s unexpected death has
made no difference in my feelings towards England,
although I find it has made a great difference in the
feeling of England towards me. My godfather, the
Archbishop, has written to me in the most cordial
spirit about my Church patronage, thanking me in
advance for my gracious patronage of Christianity.
He hints that I may play an important part in bringing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>
the Roman and Anglican communions closer together
as the sole means of preserving society. But
I do not want to preserve society. The Prime Minister&#8217;s
letter of condolence also contains a hint that
in a year or two, if I behave, I may succeed to the
Home Secretaryship&mdash;I think he means all the Cabinet
offices to become hereditary in course of time.
But I am not going to behave. England expects every
man to be a humbug, but she will be disappointed as
far as I am concerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I recollect your father saying to me once that in
many persons the infliction of pain on others&mdash;in extreme
cases, even on themselves&mdash;gives rise to sensations
of enjoyment which are actually akin to, and
have their seat in the same region as, the sensations
of physical lust. Thus the nuns who ill-use children
in their orphanages, and the Puritans who gloat over
the sufferings of profligate men and women, are really
indulging in an unnatural form of profligacy. It is
difficult to account on any other principle for what
Anglo-Saxon races call their civilizing mission. It
clearly has nothing to do with Christianity, because
the only sins seriously denounced in the Gospel are
love of money and hypocrisy, and those are the supreme
Anglo-Saxon virtues. When we find a nation
of swindlers bent on putting down polygamy in Utah,
and a nation of pirates objecting to child-marriages
in Hindustan, we are clearly face to face with some
form of insanity. And it is becoming more difficult
every day to escape out of the power of the maniacs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span>&#8220;Rousseau rendered greater services to the democracy
of Europe and America than any one man who
has ever lived. He is the author of the Declaration
of Independence, and the author of universal suffrage.
And yet if any follower of Rousseau attempted
to set up a community to lead the life which Rousseau
lived and advocated, anywhere within reach of
that democracy, it would be put down by force. This
isle is now the property of a hospital&mdash;of course, a
hospital for the benefit of the democracy. I have
written proposing to acquire the island and build
on it a hospital for men of letters, and even that is
more than democracy can tolerate; my letter has not
been acknowledged. Switzerland is covered with sanatoriums
for every kind of disease, but there is no
sanatorium for genius. The Swiss are making millions
a year out of Byron&#8217;s praises of their scenery;
they grudge the smallest corner of their soil to be a
home for other Byrons.</p>

<p>&#8220;As far as I can see, there are only three or four
countries which have still been spared a measure of
freedom, and they will not retain it very long. The
Puritans have been howling for the blood of the
Turks for generations, and I doubt if their mutual
jealousy will hold them back much longer from civilizing
the whole of Islam. China has been spared
for the moment, but it cannot be saved except on condition
that it follows the Japanese example and becomes
as greedy and bloodthirsty as the Christian
Powers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span>&#8220;However, I shall now visit the countries that have
not been annexed up to the present, and try to find
some spot where it may be possible to set up a city
of refuge. I will found a spiritual order like the
old Knights of the Temple. Who knows that we may
not be able to preserve one spot of the planet alike
from the millionaire and the Socialist, the slave-driver
and the slave?</p>

<p>&#8220;In my monastery, dear Hero, there will be neither
marrying nor giving in marriage, and none need declare
himself man or woman unless he pleases. In
all matters we shall strive to obtain freedom without
disorder, and happiness without selfishness. We shall
have many guests who will be refreshed and comforted,
and sent upon their way, but only after long
trial and approval will any be admitted to our Order.
We shall have servants, whom we shall treat as brethren
without calling them lay-brothers, and they will
do their work, as we shall do ours.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such are the thoughts and plans I wished to lay
before you, but I dare not wish that you should make
them yours. Doubtless you will consider them with
kindness and with wisdom, and will tell me your
decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall wait here another week for your answer
before setting out for the East.&#8221;</p>

<p class="ph1">THE NEW WORD</p>


<p class="center"><b>by ALLEN UPWARD</b></p>

<p class="center"><b><i>$1.50 net</i></b></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;In this book a man, who in the broader sense of
both words is at once a scientist and a seer, has
undertaken an inquiry into the sources of knowledge
and the foundations of faith, a review of the
jurisdiction of materialism and the credentials of
the idealists, that has worked out into what he
himself has admirably defined as a &#8216;circumnavigation
of hope.&#8217; Mr. Upward&#8217;s equipment as a navigator
of these reef-strewn and mirage-haunted seas is unequalled
in our day. A man of scientific training
and legal aptitude, a philologist of amazing insight,
a debater with a wide knowledge of men, a broad
culture, and a trenchant mind, no English writer of
the post-Darwinian period has approached him in
the gift of putting into living folk-speech the tangled
technicalities of the schoolmen; no controversial
critic has had at his command so vitriolic a wit and
used it so magnanimously; no ruthless iconoclast of
intellectual idols has shown himself so conservative
and yet so able an architect of intellectual optimism.
Mr. Upward&#8217;s inquiry is developed as an interpretation
of a cryptic phrase in the will of Alfred
Nobel, &#8216;a work of an idealistic tendency.&#8217; Its professed
object is &#8216;to forge upon the anvil of sense a
definition of hope that will ring true in the ear of
the materialist as well as of the idealist.&#8217; And its
prosecution is Socratic in its argumentative shrewdness,
its unity of purpose, its unswerving directness
and its triumphant simplicity.&#8221;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
